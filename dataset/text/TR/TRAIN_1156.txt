Hackers and crackers respect only one thing: strong security. Keep the bad guys out of your PC or network with the advanced technology that's trusted by millions: ZoneAlarm Pro 3.0. This best-in-class personal firewall stops hackers cold, defends your online privacy,and sets up in minutes. Click here to download now!



Well, it's been half a week since we released it, and we're still
getting record downloads for our first
FREE Gnometome. What does
that mean? Simple. Download all you want - we'll definitely make
more. In fact, we've found a way to get your products and services
a little bit of unlimited promotion on the side, too. And who
couldn't use a little more traffic nowadays? Well, unless your
data transfer bill is already sky high (which can happen when you
get featured). It's all fun and games until someone's server falls
to its knees. We're still sitting
at #5 on Amazon. If we ever
hit #1, I'll eat my hat. And, mind you, this hat has been sitting
around for quite a while; it smells like feet. You'd have to eat
three sombreros just to get the same amount of nutrition you'd get
from my hat. You're better off just going for the free stuff, I
suppose. The next time they ask: "Do you care to Super Size that?"
You can respond, with dignity: "My funds are sufficient for the
upgrade; I avoided spending money on something that would have
lasted longer, supported a helpful cause, and not have killed me
earlier." It makes sense - if you think about it. The fries aren't
going to eat themselves. And if YOU don't eat the fries, who will?



Put your hunger aside for just a moment. It's time for a paragraph
I like to call: "Why you shouldn't sign up for DirectDSL." They
went out of their way to send me an unsolicited e-mail this
evening. Now, I know what you're thinking: "How kind of them,
Chris. You were just asking about DSL providers in yesterday's
issue. They must have read your mind!" No, they must have rented a
list of addresses which weren't confirmed. But the fun didn't stop
there. I received a message about DirectTV from yet ANOTHER
marketing company. Their effort was indeed caught by this crafty
eye, and my money will be diverted to other (less-spammish)
businesses in the future. It's my "direct" way of saying: you're
not the only game in town. Anybody else care to test my patience?
I didn't think so. My blacklist gets shared with 250,000 people
from around the world. Oops! My Inbox just got slammed with more
junk; looks like Lycos will never get another click from me,
either. See what you get when you tempt fate?



My good buddy, Bill,
tells me that Speakeasy.net
provides great DSL connections. He'll even get the credit if I
sign up through his affiliate link! Paul Howes agrees with him,
too: "Static IPs are the norm, they do not use PPPoE, and they
encourage people to run servers on their DSL connection. When
looking at their packages, I suggest you look at the 'Home
Services' page. They even have ADSL up to 1.5M downstream / 768k
upstream, which I have not seen from any other provider. And that
is less than $200 a month, which is a bargain when you start
looking at the prices of a 768k SDSL line!" And Stuart Portner is
chock full of common sense: "Remember that a lot of DSL providers
give you the modem for free and prefer that you use theirs - at
least for initial setup / shakedown period." All the more fries
for me, dude!




See You in August,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris Pirillo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Company Overview v1.3 [389k] W9x/2k/XP FREE

http://www.toteboard.net/Models/company_overview.htm


{Check your stocks} When you're doing long-term investing, the
best thing to do with your money is to invest and then "forget
about it." Our Gnomie buddy Brian Stevens is the type of guy that
likes to play the stock market. He's always logging into E*TRADE
and checking on his stocks. That's a lot of work! We told him to
forget about it and let Company Overview do the work. This Excel
spreadsheet and add-in is a great way to check stocks and save the
data into a separate Excel spreadsheet. Brian says, "E*TRADE
doesn't give me half the information that Company Overview does,
such as insider trades and financial trends, along with many other
tidbits of information." NOTE: You must use Excel 2000 or higher
for the spreadsheet to operate correctly.



Flexible Renamer v5.2.0 [426k] W9x/2k/XP FREE

http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA014830/english/FlexRena/


{Rename your files} I work with a lot of files throughout the day,
and sometimes I end up with a desktop cluttered with useless
copies and shortcuts - and you KNOW how I feel about clutter. I
don't need a reminder that there are five shortcuts or six copies
of something on my desktop... and that is where Flexible Renamer
comes into the picture. With Flexible Renamer, I can cut off the
"Shortcut to" and "Copy of" prefixes from all my files, making
them a lot easier to read. That's not all though... you can even
make a .txt file on your desktop into a .doc document in seconds.
If you don't like your filename in all caps, then just switch them
to lower case and vice-versa. The possibilities are endless! (You
know, I always wanted to change my own name from "Chris" to
"Caspian Wildflowers"...)

Disk Investigator v1.1 [527k] W9x/2k/XP FREE

http://www.theabsolute.net/sware/dskinv.html


{Restore deleted files} Have you ever deleted a file from your PC,
realizing later that you actually needed it? Yeah, me too. Best-
case scenario, I would just go to the Recycle Bin and retrieve my
deleted file. But what if I had already emptied the Recycle Bin?
(Horrors!) Luckily, Disk Investigator can come into play and save
the day. (Yay!) With Disk Investigator, I can view deleted files
or directories, and restore them if necessary. I no longer have to
wonder if I fully deleted a troublesome file... I just load up
Disk Investigator, and I'll know if the file is gone (with 100%
certainty)!

Actual Title Buttons 1.3 [1.0M] W9x/2k/XP $19.95
    Unearthed by Michael Tretyakov

http://www.actualtools.com/


{Windows Explorer add-on} "Actual Title Buttons lets you add the
new Minimize To Tray and Stay On Top buttons to any program's
title bar next to the Windows standard Minimize/Maximize/Close
buttons." This program is a must for anyone who wants to avoid the
distractions of other windows popping up over your active windows.
While writing this review, I am using the "Stay On Top" command
for Notepad, and during this time I have already received five
instant messages. Why is this important? Normally these messages
would pop up in front of Notepad and disrupt my work... but with
Actual Title Buttons, I can keep typing without missing those
"important" instant messages. The only difference is that they
aren't an annoyance now. The "Minimize To Tray" feature is great,
too, because freeing up taskbar space is a beautiful thing...
especially when you don't have to close down your programs to do
it.

Electricon Land

http://www.electriconland.com/


{Icons for your machine} Gretchen and I are really looking forward
to moving to our new neighborhood in a little over a month.
Everything is better with a little dash of friendliness, right?
Icons are no exception. All the action on this website is based
around a city block of Electriconland. You walk into different
stores to get different pixel art icons. Walk into Gabu's Pub and
you will find icons in the likeness of Pink Floyd. You won't be
disappointed when you go around the corner and pick up your
Avengers icons from the comic store. If all this wasn't good
enough then maybe this fact alone will send you to the street of
Electriconland... all the icons are cross platform. This means you
can have your new favorite icons on your Windows, Mac, and Linux
machine, or maybe even a different one on each. The possibilities
are endless!

&nbsp;GnomeTIP

I just hate it when I try to install a program and the
installation fails. I hate it even more when the program doesn't
leave a log file to help me track down the problem. Some would say
I am out of luck, but as long as the program uses Windows
Installer, then I am on Cloud Nine. Why am I so happy? Because for
any program that uses Windows Installer, I can turn on logging
through the Registry. Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \
Policies \ Microsoft \ Windows \ Installer. Add a new String
value, double-click it, and enter the following Value data:
"voicewarmup" (sans quotes). These letters can be entered in any
order: v = Verbose output; o = Out- of-disk-space messages; i =
Status messages; c = Initial UI parameters; e = All error
messages; w = Non-fatal warnings; a = Start up of actions; r =
Action-specific records; m = Out-of- memory or fatal exit
information; u = User requests; p = Terminal properties. If you
add a plus, the existing file will be appended. If you add an
exclamation mark, each line is flushed. Now, when something fails,
I just have to check in the "Temp" directory and look for my log
files. They'll vary in name, but will always start with "Msi" and
end with the .LOG extension. As always, make sure to backup your
registry before making any modifications.

And now, we see how Sprocket thinks he has a right to eat pumpkin seeds. Or, would that be "pupkin" seeds?
