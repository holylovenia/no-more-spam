Hi Celejar,




Thank you for your reply.




I use Linux running in&#160; Compact Flash so that the size of the Compact flash memory is the 
limit




Users will&#160; send emails to a program running in the Compact flash so I need a mail server 
there too.




Only SMTP, no POP3 server




Can you suggest something?











Thank you .




Best regards,




Lad.

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know about a tiny&#160; / liteweight&#160; SMTP server for Linux( Debian)? I need the 




&gt; &gt; server that can accept several connections at the same time .




&gt; &gt; I do not need POP3 server




&gt; 




&gt; I'm not sure that I can help, but what, exactly, do you mean by tiny /




&gt; liteweight?&#160; Binary size, CPU / RAM usage?&#160; IIUC, even the heavy




&gt; hitters like Exim use very few resources when not under load.&#160; E.g., on




&gt; my system, htop shows Exim at 0 CPU, and only &quot;6484 648 588&quot; for &quot;VIRT




&gt; RES SHR&quot;.




&gt; 




&gt; This has come up before on the list.&#160; What, exactly, are your




&gt; restrictions / goals?
