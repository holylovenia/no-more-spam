  FINDING QUICKER SOLUTIONS AND SOLVING 
  PROBLEMS QUICKER


  &nbsp;


  When you are fully booked and
overloaded 
  with work there are still the possibility to use the&nbsp;ancient mental 
  working methods, used by successful people,&nbsp;instead of the risk for 
  stress and burn out problems.


  &nbsp;


  These ancient methods for shortening 
  waiting time, adding power to a quicker decision, eliminating stress and
the 
  risk for burn out, are not so commonly used, despite the methods&nbsp;are 
  known from ancient time.


  &nbsp;


  The power in the mental working
methods 
  claim for no extra energy consumption so the body will not get tired,
stressed 
  or burn out.
