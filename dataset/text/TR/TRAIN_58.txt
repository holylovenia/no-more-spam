Know that feng shui always works best when it is applied in a subtle way. Do not have little
wind chimes hanging from your computer or bring bagua mirrors and three legged frogs. Find office decor-appropriate solutions to improve your space, solutions that you like and that fit into the overall office environment. Last but sure not least, if you know that your office set-up has challenging feng shui and there is not much you can do about it, make an extra effort to create good feng shui in your home, especially in your bedroom. This will assure that your personal energy is receiving the needed replenishment and support to be able to withstand hours in a questionable feng shui office environment. ·See what feng shui office energizers you are allowed to bring into your space and go for their best placement. Some of the feng shui must-have for the office are air-purifying plants and high energy items, such as photos that carry the energy of happy moments or bright, inspiring art with vibrant colors. ·If you have your back to the door, be sure to find a way to see the reflection of the entrance, meaning to have a view of what is going on behind your back. You can do that with any strategically placed office related-object made from shiny metal.
