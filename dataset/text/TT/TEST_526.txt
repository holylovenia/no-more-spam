        "A case in point is web designer Matt Jones, the man 
         responsible for how BBC News Online looked when it launched. 
         Since then, he has invented 'warchalking', which he recently 
         described as a 'curse'..."

                                >> HARD NEWS > ANTI-NEWS > EVENT QUEUE > TRACKING > MEMEPOOL > GEEK MEDIA > celebrity cameo night tonight, with Brad Pitt in FRIENDS 
         (9pm, Fri, C4), Sydney Pollack in WILL AND GRACE (9.30pm, Fri, 
         C4), Dustin Hoffman in V GRAHAM NORTON (10.30pm, Fri, C4), and 
         a singing, dancing peanut in globalised trade documentary ALT-
         TV (7.30pm, Fri, C4)... the BBC have kept McEnroe and the 
         heart monitor, got rid of the live crocodiles in gimmicky 
         quizshow THE CHAIR (6.40pm, Sat, BBC1)... and a month of 
         "September 11th" specials kicks off with AVENGING TERROR (8pm, 
         Sat & Sun, C4) - yet those responsible for BOWFINGER (9pm, 
         Sat, C4) and NOTTING HILL (9pm, Sun, C4) still remain 
         unpunished... John "The Last Seduction" Dahl's ROUNDERS (11pm, 
         Sat, BBC2) turns out to be about high-stakes poker, rather 
         than the girls' version of baseball... in the wake of DAVE 
         GORMAN'S IMPORTANT ASTROLOGY EXPERIMENT (10.40pm, Sun, BBC2), 
         how about a three-way challenge where he, Tony Hawks and Pete 
         McCarthy battle to come up with the most lucrative pointless 
         pretext for a book and TV show?... but we still have a soft 
         spot for Ron "Alien: Resurrection" Perlman liberal self-
         flagellation THE LAST SUPPER (11.20pm, Sun, C4)... 9/11 CLEAR 
         THE SKIES (9pm, Sun, BBC2) is a presumably uneventful account 
         of "how US air defence systems responded to the events of 
         September 11th"... inexplicably, the three finalists in THE 
         TARTIEST MEN IN BRITAIN (10.30pm, Mon, ITV) all come from 
         Leeds... Larry Clark takes a somewhat indirect approach to 
         conveying his safe-sex message in New York filth-fest KIDS 
         (1.15am, Tue, C4)... and the September 11th build-up continues 
         with HOW THE TWIN TOWERS COLLAPSED (8pm, Mon, C4), LET'S ROLL: 
         THE STORY OF FLIGHT 93 (10.30pm, Wed, ITV), plus THE MEYSSAN 
         CONSPIRACY (11.05pm, Tue, C4) - ie the French guy behind: 
       http://www.asile.org/citoyens/numero13/pentagone/erreurs_en.htm
         ... away from the polluted nightmare of modern living, a 
         family seek out a new way of life in Earth Summit tie-in A 
         LAND WORTH LOVING (7pm, Wed, BBC1)... which coincidentally 
         also forms the plot of this week's second Heather "Bowfinger" 
         Graham turkey, LOST IN SPACE (7.55pm, Wed, BBC1) - not to be 
         confused with the return of those annoying posh women in 
         WORLD'S WORST DRESSED (8pm, Wed, BBC2), who have at least shut 
         up about their always-doomed hideously purple e-commerce 
         site: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/712188.stm ...
         
         FILM>> the comic skills of Cameron Diaz, Christina Applegate 
         and Parker Posey combine in a cross between a teen smut comedy 
         and an episode of "Sex And The City", THE SWEETEST THING 
         ( http://www.screenit.com/movies/2002/the_sweetest_thing.html :
         As [Diaz] and [Applegate] drive down the road still dressed in 
         just their bras and underwear, [Applegate] drops her bottle of 
         fingernail polish. [Diaz] then goes over to get it, with 
         her panty-covered butt in the air and her head down toward 
         [Applegate]'s legs and crotch; [Selma Blair] [has] her mouth 
         stuck around a man's privates after apparently performing oral 
         sex on him)... Robin Williams plays a surprisingly convincing 
         Hannibal Lecter in morally complicated Alaskan Al Pacino 
         murder madness INSOMNIA ( http://www.cndb.com/ : You can see 
         [Crystal Lowe's] tits in autopsy photos and again - along with 
         bush - when she's seen on a autopsy table. Nice boobs but 
         she's dead)... it's Eddie Murphy, Randy Quaid, Jay "Jerry 
         Maguire" Mohr, John Cleese and Pam Grier - together at last! - 
         in blaxploitation sci-fi spoof THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH 
  ( http://www.screenit.com/movies/2002/the_adventures_of_pluto_nash.html :
         the woman then causes the image of [Rosario "Kids" Dawson] to 
         suddenly have much larger breasts and an exaggeratedly large 
         rear end)... all of which, shockingly, are an improvement on 
         John Woo interspersing lame battle scenes with agonising anti-
         racist philosophising in WW2 Navajo crypto clunker WINDTALKERS 
         ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/windtalkers.htm : 
         gambling; beheading; brief partial nudity of a Japanese 
         soldier; I have no doubt that such gore is present in war but 
         must it be regurgitated in and as entertainment?)...
