I thought about doing that but it looks like the only deb is a 32 bit
one and we are running 64 bit :(

I'd say that the file apt downloaded is corrupted. Maybe trying ""apt-get
clean"" to remove all downloaded files first would solve the problem.

I posted about this last week, and I'm still stumped.  apt-get is just
not working for me, and I can't figure out what the problem is.

behind (/etc/apt /var/state/apt /var/cache/apt), and still, I get

401,"QuickTime Player 7 recording problem (maximum duration for the file
	has been reached)After one of the recent QuickTime updates QT Player 7 (Pro) seems to  
have lost its ability to record movies from video digitizer  
components. It shows preview all right but once the user presses the  
Record button, it writes exactly one frame to the .mov file and stops  
with the error message ""Recording stopped because the maximum duration  
for the file has been reached"". The same thing happened with all vdigs  
I have installed on my Mac, including Apple's SoftVDigX sample.

QT Player does record movies from iSight but unfortunately it's not  
doing that via QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer (otherwise it would be  
possible to trace QT component calls and find the difference between  
Apple's vdig and mine). And every piece of software that works with  
QuickTimeUSBVDCDigitizer, works with my vdig too. Ugh...

The following versions do NOT work for me:

QuickTime Player 7 Version 7.6.6 (1709) + QuickTime Version 7.6.6  
(1729) + Mac OS X 10.6.3
QuickTime Player Version 7.6.6 (1632) + QuickTime Version 7.6.6 (1674)  
+ Mac OS X 10.5.8

This one (still) does work:

QuickTime Player Version 7.6.4 (518.35) + QuickTime Version 7.6.4  
(1327.73) + Mac OS X 10.4.11

Does anyone know a way to make a vdig component (say, SoftVDigX)  
compatible with the latest QT Player 7?

Thanks in advance,
-Slava

1175,"Gecko adhesion finally sussed.(Via Robot Wisdom)   Maybe you UC folk know these people?

http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2002-08/lcc-sph082202.php

Working at Lewis & Clark College, the University of California at Berkeley, 
the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Stanford University, 
the interdisciplinary team:

    * confirmed speculation that the gecko's amazing climbing ability 
depends on weak molecular attractive forces called van der Waals forces,

    * rejected a competing model based on the adhesion chemistry of water 
molecules, and

* discovered that the gecko's adhesive depends on geometry, not surface 
chemistry. In other words, the size and shape of the tips of gecko foot 
hairs--not what they are made of--determine the gecko's stickiness.

To verify its experimental and theoretical results, the gecko group then 
used its new data to fabricate prototype synthetic foot-hair tips from two 
different materials.

""Both artificial setal tips stuck as predicted,"" notes Autumn, assistant 
professor of biology at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore. ""Our 
initial prototypes open the door to manufacturing the first biologically 
inspired dry, adhesive microstructures, which can have widespread 
applications."""
1681,"shouldn't apt-get upgrade, you know, upgrade ?
Hi all,

I was having some problems with ooffice so I did ""apt-get update"" and
then ran ""apt-get upgrade"" to see if ooffice was among the packages to
be upgraded.  It wasn't, but I tried ""apt-get install ooffice""
anyway, and presto it started upgrading ooffice.

So I looked at the man-page:

 upgrade
is used to install the newest versions of all packages currently
installed on the system

I did, in fact, have ooffice installed so I'm not clean on why upgrade
alone did seem to want to upgrade the package.

Any ideas ?

Thanks,

Brian

be given away, WHY not to YOU?

You may be thinking, ""How

Maybe you think it's impossible
to get free money?

impossible! It's a fact, ordinary people and businesses all across the
United States are receiving millions of dollars from these Government and
Private Foundation's everyday.

are possible! GRANTS don't have to be paid back,
EVER! Claim
your slice of the FREE American Pie.

This money is not a loan,
Trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.
These Government Agencies don't have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do.

You decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the Government
Agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
This money is non taxable &amp; interest free.

None of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and U.S. citizen are entitled to this money.

There are currently over
1,400 Federal Programs, 24,000 State Programs, 30,000 Private Foundations

Getting Business
Grants

Anyone thinking about going
into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-money-shop"" where FREE business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the Federal
Government.

It
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the United
States of America wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:

Over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in FREE
consulting and research grants.

With an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!

In
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.

Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.

Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well. 
Register for Gnomedex today!   


I've finally done it! Lockrgnome's Top 50 
Mac OS X Tips is in publication 
and available for purchase at GnomeTomes.com. Less than half the tips have 
appeared in the Apple Core newsletter already, so purchasing them means 
getting mostly brand new content. This represents the first thing I've 
written that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, 
I'll be ecstatic. And hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will 
find them useful. I know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things 
on the list has improved my personal OS X experience.

Although this newsletter started out with Chris, Randy, and I writing 
sections of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the 
contributions of the other two guys. This does not mean either of them is 
truly less involved, it just means I'm doing more writing. Both Chris and 
Randy regularly send me links to cool Mac stuff they find, much of which 
will ultimately end up in upcoming issues. Since the writing will be 
primarily mine, I've opted to eliminate the ""Review by"" links at the bottom 
of each article. Unless otherwise noted, you can safely assume I wrote it. 
If you need to send me an e-mail, the E-mail The Editors Link in the 
sidebar will reach me, as well as putting your message in front of Chris 
and Randy.

I've been doing some exploring of AppleScript over the past several months 
and believe I'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that I'm going 
to add a section on scripting to the newsletter. I'm curious to know what 
your level of experience with scripting is, because I can either start with 
some really basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting 
topics. Either way, I'm open to some 
AppleScript suggestions.

Sherlock Plugins v2.2 [600k] Mac OS 9/OSX FREE

http://www.searchstandard.com/


While doing some research for my top 50 tips, I discovered that turning 
off some of Sherlock's extras, like multi-language indexing, in the 
preferences will speed things up considerably, particularly for local 
machine searches. This renewed my interest in finding ways to add-on 
search capabilities to the bundled sleuth, resulting in my discovery of 
SearchStandard.com. This bundled collection of search plug-ins makes it 
possible to look for almost anything using Sherlock. Their Web site 
won't wow you, but SearchStandard's free plugins most certainly make 
finding things online, including searches on your favorite Mac sites, 
that much easier.




&nbsp;GnomeNETWORK
Xnet v1.0.6 [216k] OSX $48

http://bitcom.ch/products-xnet-e.html

Dealing with servers that offer mission critical services, like 
intranet access, e-mail, or Web serving, means dealing with those 
services failing from time to time. Don't be left in the dark 
when one of your services go down, let Xnet keep you informed. 
The unregistered version of the product lets you verify http, 
ping, smtp, and ftp service availability, with many more service 
verifications included in the pro version. Xnet runs on your 
local machine, verifying remote service availability and sending 
you a message when those services go down. The interface allows 
for user-defined services, with alert features for both an e-mail 
account (mine alerts are going to my cell phone) and locally via 
a sound from your machine.




&nbsp;GnomeTERMINAL

For OS X installs with multiple users, there may come a time when you 
need to change ownership of a particular file. This is particularly 
useful in situations where one user created a file, but an entirely 
different user is the only one who will ever make future decisions 
relating to that file, like whether to keep it or throw it in the 
Trash. chown is the Terminal command designed to handle this. From 
the command line type:

sudo chown username filename

You'll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for 
username. The name of the file receiving a change of ownership will 
replace filename.






50 LINUX TIPS: From the mind behind the Penguin Shell come two

or command line guru, you'll want these tips as part of your

Susan Kare

http://www.kare.com

As we move further into the future of Apple's Mac OS evolution, it 
remains important to understand where things evolved from. Susan 
Kare designed all the original icons for the Mac OS, way back in 
1983. In fact, that smiling Mac that appears as OS X boots is her 
creation. Check out her collection of UI artwork, from both Windows 
and Mac operating systems. Also available from Kare.com are Kare 
designed icon apparel and collections of fonts as designed by Susan.


&nbsp;GnomeTIP

Show Info gives you access to change the application associated with a 
particular file type, rename files, and reassign permissions. One of 
the best features of Show Info is it's ability to store ""comments"" 
related to a file or application. This can be a great place to store 
information on recently made changes to a file, information from others 
who've looked at a file, or in the case of applications, serial numbers 
and other pertinent data you may need when dealing with tech support.

I listed the machine closest to your requirements in my last email.  It
meets all your requirements but for the 2MB L2 cache.  TTBOMK, there are no
netbooks with 2MB L2 cpu cache.  Neither AMD nor Intel make a CPU with 2MB

Your running mailscanner and the timeout used got to check ORDB-RBL is too 
low and your timing out.  mailscanner will count up to seven timeouts and 
then automatically disable these checks until it restarts itself (within 4 
hours).

758,"This little domain went to China....The RIAA continues to amaze me.    Everyone might want to grok the
news yahoo has:

http://rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/nm/tc_nm/inlinks/*http://Listen4ever.com


And if you're really bored, go ahead and read the papers that were
filed by the RIAA against the major backbone providers.

http://www.riaa.com/pdf/Listen4Ever.pdf


So it looks like the RIAA is getting bored with its usual tack of
suing the peer-to-peer services, and is instead using the DMCA
to sue ISPs and backbones into compliance --  They want said backbones
to block the ip address of the listen4ever.com server due to
listen4ever's alleged infringement of copyright.  To quote
the Motion that the RIAA issued:  ""Plaintiffs request that
the Court issue a preliminary injunction requiring Defendants to block
communication to and from Listen4ever's servers that travel through
Defendants' backbone routing systems"".

At least according to the RIAA (probably for bonus terror tactics )
the Listen4ever site is even more formidable than that bane of p2p
goodness, Napster, due to the fact that its on a centralized server,
out of their reach of RIAA/DMCA control (its located in China), and
because according to the RIAA it facilitates the downloading of entire albums.
Apparently listen4ever has a few other sites floating around, and the RIAA has been
unsuccessful in getting any of them to voluntarily surrender
service(1).

Gotta love the RIAA for jumping into this lawsuit with the customer's
interests in mind.  How lawyers can write drivel along the lines of
'if you dont stop these guys, we'll run out of money and we won't be
able to supply you new music!' just blows my mind, especially in this
day and age.   The RIAA has enough money to file inane lawsuits
against backbone providers, but they don't have enough money to
produce new artists?  Something seems wrong here.

Here's my problem.  Say the RIAA wins in court, and the backbone
providers comply.   Their biggest hurdle is now accomplished, and one
hell of a terrible precident is/can be set.   At least in the RIAA's
case, I'm sure once they get a Court-mandated Ok for this particular
site, they'll just go ahead, write their nice friendly lawyer letters,
and demand that subsequent IP addresses also be blocked, as they too
route to sites that are problematic to the RIAA.

Even worse, the concept that other groups (the first that flashed into
my little brain being the Scientologists) also decide that this is the way
to go.   If the RIAA prevails, they have record set, albiet in NY
only, that can be pointed back to, and used in other cases.
Eventually this will hit a large enough court that precident will set,
 and we have a very quiet, very non-reported event occuring from then
 on, the systematic C&Ding of the Internet.   Anything that violates the
DMCA, given its takedown provisions, might now potentially
fall prey to a Cease & Desist letter.  Rather than appealing, the
backbone providers will just agree -- as they seem likely to do
'provided a court order'.

Point being is that soon this won't take a court order.  A nastygram
will suffice and we'll wonder where all the new
music/information/dissenting opinions/ criticisms went.

This is a scary road we're running down here.   So nice to see that
its still hush-hush in the geek community.

Whats more bizzare is some of the support(?) that the RIAA seemed to
get.   I'm curious for instance, how Dave Farber got dragged into
this...  (2) Dave, you still read FoRK?

(1) Save for one, lmp3.com, which was listed as a redirect site in the
court documents, has since gone down.   Their website has a humorous little note:  ""Lmp3
will be closed and will never come back! "".  Listen4ever.com is not
responding, but i'm not quite sure if thats due to backbone compliance
or the site being overburdened.

Lioness adopts fifth antelope

Rory Carroll, Africa correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

Kamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting
her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled
wildlife experts.
The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her
latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.
Each time Kamuniak, whose name means ""the blessed one"" in the local Samburu
tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed
the natural mothers to feed them.
Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while
Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by
their natural mothers.
The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari (""taken by
force""), was adopted at the weekend.
""She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony,"" said
Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden.
Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a
distance.
Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak
is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are
cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour
and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants
to be loved.

Ughhh, yes, *it's a typo* (I copied/pasted from the site and didn't

Mmmm, that should not affect. If you can print from other programs, 
Acroread should do the same. If it fails, it sounds to me like a bug on 
their side.

>I really think that with my ALSA packages, ALSA on Red Hat Linux has never

I had been hand building those alsa packages for probably 6 months or more, so I
could use my laptop's ESS chip best (hard disk recording and such). Wow, maybe 8 to
10 months, time flys. I didn't look forward to doing that tedious build every time I
changed a kernel or something. Matthias has made this a thing of the past! Dude,
it's a no brainer, use apt-get or just download and install.

What's more, OSS is fully ""imitated"", older apps using OSS are as happy as a clam.
My personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better (alsaplayer, xmms
with alsa module) to my ear.

The 2 things that trick people are the modules.conf file, they didn't have that
automatic matrix page when I started with alsa, you don't know how good you have it.

And on my old installs (only the first time I installed it on a clean box), alsa
always was ""muted"" until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music. It's possible
Matthias even took care of that too. Anyway it is/was only a one time thing on 1st
install, that was a long time ago for me.

Those ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the 2.4 kernel but missed it, but
it's been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel.

Thugs of South Boston and The Revenge of the Bandit Princess


The Geodesic Economy
Robert A. Hettinga
Sunday, August 25, 2002

(BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs.
Patriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war
between thugs.

Put crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang
were the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha's ""family"" were, of
course, the (mostly) Italian thugs.


Think Scorsese's upcoming ""Gangs of New York"", only with
counter-reformatory overtones. Hoover's South Boston ""social-club""
putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in
hindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite
a reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets by
the Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not
for New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US,
only makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to
its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime
there once and for all.

The result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of
Italian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was,
posthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine
- -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence
in Whitey Bulger's crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston's drug markets,
like the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other
also-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of
magnitude, not mere percentage points.

As Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. And, make
no mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that ""quality""
of carnage, nation-wide.


So, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one
gang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at
least, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with
apparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on
the gears of ""justice"" like so much hamburger.

However, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was
""greasing"", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could
love: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence --
on paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door,
but still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken's famous ""bluenoses
and busybodies"".


It all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of
beginnings. What she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy
then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a
smaller, ""manageable"" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more
heads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition,
in more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on.

Every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or
harmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now,
apparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing
happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead
years. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely
lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently
scale newly-legislated ""barriers to competition"" imposed on them by
the state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of
those substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of
evil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly
coercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred
liberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry.

As Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't need
government if nobody's breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to
Parkinson's Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people,
breaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they
confiscate at tax time.

And, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably
echo here his father Milton's famous observation that government
regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and
never the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even,
*especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in
the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our
government now imposes on us.


And there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati.

In fact, Hayek himself, in ""The Road to Serfdom"", couldn't have
predicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover's blatant
imposition, ""for our own good"", of Vietnam-era statist power at the
neighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn't have had
better ""useful idiots"" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an
absolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover.

Useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who
were eating out of Hoover's power-craven hand for the entire middle
of the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger's hand, whether they knew it
or not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you'll notice, which
saw the increasingly steady imposition of ""mob"" violence, and market
control, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the
imaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting,
movie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little
Caesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now
strictly political, descendents.

In terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr.
Salvati and the others, dead or alive, as a ""transfer-price"", in
human lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style
Vietnam-era Keynesian ""social-cost"" input-output accounting at its
most despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that
was committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic
control, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just a
race war between thugs up in Boston.


This shouldn't be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least
fought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, and
endorsed, at the time, by all the ""right"" people, for all the ""right""
reasons.

As far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson's observation
that a ""prince"" is just a stationary bandit.

Though, given his penchant for women's clothing, for other men, and,
what's actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of
people of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J.
Edgar Hoover a bandit ""princess"", instead.

""Bandit Queen"", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens --
and real bandits -- everywhere.

Cheers,
RAH

Hoover's F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOX
BUTTERFIELD

BOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar
Hoover's war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional
investigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of
New England's organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca.

Two gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr.
Patriarca's permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan,
""as they were having a problem with him,"" according to an F.B.I. log
of the conversation. ""Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.,"" the
F.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an
alley, shot six times.

It was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of
Investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known
gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England
Mafia was involved.

But when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real
killers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were
left alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to
death or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing
to do with it.

One, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with
the Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I.
for $300 million for false imprisonment.

His is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the
Justice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled,
corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.'s Boston
office in its effort to bring down the mob.

The lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years
in a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of
the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light,
including documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca
approved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation
by the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the
department into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston.

The documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently
including Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents
were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were
protecting them from prosecution.

""J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal
himself,"" said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati's lawyer. ""He allowed a
witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect
one of his informants.""

Mr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and
may have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark
who worked for Mr. Barboza.

Asked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr.
Salvati's innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a
spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the
pending litigation.

A Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate
misconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the
investigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting
sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and
obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were
F.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and
Stephen Flemmi are brothers.

The Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton,
Republican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston
office to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau's knowledge
that Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr.
Deegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime,
including who fired the first shot.

Then, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover's office demanded to know what
progress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer.

In a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston
office said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot
wounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca ""potentially
could be an excellent informant.""

The agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have
killed seven men, ""and, from all indications, he is going to continue
to commit murder."" Nevertheless, the agent said, ""the informant's
potential outweighs the risk involved.""

A Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. ""The most
frightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi's murders,
the director does not even respond,"" the investigator said. ""There is
no message not to use a murderer as a government informant.""

The origin of the corruption scandal was public and political
pressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing
power of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I.
agents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties
to a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr.
Bulger.

Both sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and
the trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually
helped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled
organized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger's gang was able to take
over the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while
the F.B.I. looked the other way.

One reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr.
Patriarca's involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional
investigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device
in his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who
transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was
coming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device,
the investigators say.

Mr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted
in 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on
parole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state
judge after the Justice Department task force made public documents
suggesting his innocence.

Two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their
survivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million
lawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to
die in the electric chair. His life was spared only when
Massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974.

Mr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston's North End with
his wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30
years. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put
on the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each
other.

It's a myth that we don't use parts of our brain.  We use it all,
always.  It's just that our culturally-induced focal-point causes most
of us to most of the time ignore and waste 99.999% of it.  ""Lucid"" is
a measure of notch-filter bandwidth; all stations are broadcasting,
but we only /choose/ Easy Rock 105.

For example, don't look now but your shoes are full of feet.

The sensation of toes the above statement evokes is not a ""turning on""
of circuits, it is a ""tuning in"".  The next step, of course, is to
""drop out"" :)

1778,"CBS News' interview w/Bush & reconstruction of his peregrinations
""60 Minutes II"" Bush Interview:

(CBS)No president since Abraham Lincoln has seen such horrific loss of 
life in a war on American soil. No president since James Madison, nearly 
200 years ago, has seen the nations capital city successfully attacked. 
But, one year ago, President George W. Bush was thrown into the first 
great crisis of the 21st century.

This is the presidents story of September 11th and the week America 
went to war. 60 Minutes II spent two hours with Mr. Bush, one, on Air 
Force One and another in the Oval Office last week. Even after a year, 
the president is still moved, sometimes to the point of tears, when he 
remembers Sept. 11.

I knew, the farther we get away from Sept.11, the more likely it is for 
some around the world to forget the mission, but not me, Mr. Bush says 
during the Air Force One interview. Not me. I made the pledge to myself 
and to people that Im not going to forget what happened on Sept. 11. So 
long as Im president, we will pursue the killers and bring them to 
justice. We owe that to those who have lost their lives.

The memories come back sharp and clear on Air Force One, where Pelley 
joined the president for a recent trip across country. 60 Minutes II 
wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first 
hours after the attack.

Not since Lyndon Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One has the airplane 
been so central to America in a crisis.

For President Bush, Sept. 11 2001, started with the usual routine. 
Before dawn, the president was on his four-mile run. It was just before 
6 a.m. and, at the same moment, another man was on the move: Mohammad 
Atta. Two hours later, as Mr. Bush drove to an elementary school, 
hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the 
airliners east. As the motorcade neared the school at 8:45 a.m., jet 
engines echoed in Manhattan.

Atta plunged the 767 jumbo jet into World Trade Center Tower One.

I thought it was an accident, says Mr. Bush. I thought it was a pilot 
error. I thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and - and made a 
terrible mistake.

Mr. Bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a 
class of second graders. He was watching a reading drill when, just 
after nine, United Flight 175 exploded into the second tower. There was 
the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was 
a coordinated attack.

Back in the Florida classroom, press secretary Ari Fleischer got the 
news on his pager. The presidents chief-of-staff, Andy Card stepped in.

A second plane hit the second tower; America is under attack, Card 
told the president

When he said those words, what did he see in the Presidents face?

I saw him coming to recognition of what I had said, Card recalls. I 
think he understood that he was going to have to take command as 
commander-in-chief, not just as president.

What was going through Bushs mind when he heard the news?

Were at war and somebody has dared attack us and were going to do 
something about it, Mr. Bush recalls. I realized I was in a unique 
setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us, and I was 
looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war. I 
can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to 
get the calls and seeing the look on their face. And it became evident 
that we were, you know, that the world had changed.

Mr. Bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone. He called 
the vice president, pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the 
attack on TV. Then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first 
words to the nation.

""Ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for America, he said 
in the speech. Today, weve had a national tragedy.

It was 9:30 a.m. As he spoke, Mr. Bush didnt know that two more 
hijacked jets were streaking toward Washington. Vice Pesident Dick 
Cheney was in his office at the White House when a Secret Service agent 
ran in.

He said to me, Sir, we have to leave immediately and grabbed, put a 
hand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the 
door of my office, Cheney recalls. Im not sure how they do it, but 
they sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast.

There wasnt a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice 
president, says Secret Service Director Brian Stafford, who was in his 
command center ordering the round-up of top officials and the First 
Family. He felt that he had only minutes to work with. We knew there 
were unidentified planes tracking in our direction, he says.

Cheney was rushed deep under the White House into a bunker called the 
Presidential Emergency Operations Center. It was built for war, and this 
was it. On her way down, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice 
called Mr. Bush.

It was brief because I was being pushed to get off the phone and get 
out of the West Wing, says Rice. They were hurrying me off the phone 
with the president and I just said, he said, Im coming back and we 
said Mr. President that may not be wise. I remember stopping briefly 
to call my family, my aunt and uncle in Alabama and say, Im fine. You 
have to tell everybody that Im fine but then settling into trying to 
deal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, I 
think the thing that was on everybodys mind was how many more planes 
are coming.

The Capitol was evacuated. And for the first time ever, the Secret 
Service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of 
succession. Agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become 
president if the others were killed. They wanted to move Vice President 
Cheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. But Cheney says 
when he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the 
White House, no matter what.

Its important to emphasize it's not personal, you dont think of it in 
personal terms, youve got a professional job to do, says Cheney.

Cheney was joined by transportation secretary Norm Mineta who remembers 
hearing the FAA counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the 
capital.

Says Mineta: Someone came in and said Mr. Vice president theres a 
plane 50 miles out, then he came in and said Its now 10 miles out, we 
dont know where it is exactly, but its coming in low and fast.

It was American Flight 77. At 9:38 a.m., it exploded into the Pentagon, 
the first successful attack on Washington since the War of 1812.

As the Pentagon burned, Mr. Bushs limousine sped toward Air Force One 
in Florida. At that moment, United Flight 93 - the last hijacked plane - 
was taking dead aim at Washington. At the White House, the staff was in 
the West Wing cafeteria, watching on TV. Press Secretary Jennifer 
Millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate.

I no sooner walked outside when someone from the Secret Service yelled 
Women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run, and suddenly 
the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and 
the whole White House just flooded out, she recalls.

In Florida, as Mr. Bush boarded Air Force One, he was overheard telling 
a Secret Service agent Be sure to get the First Lady and my daughters 
protected. At 9:57 a.m., Air Force One thundered down the runway, 
blasting smoke and dust in a full -hrust take off. Communications 
Director Dan Bartlett was on board.

It was like a rocket, he remembers. For a good ten minutes, the plane 
was going almost straight up.

At the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, World Trade Center 
Tower Two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche 
of steel, concrete and human lives.

Someone said to me, Look at that I remember that, Look at that and 
I looked up and I saw and I just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and 
the horror of that moment, recalls Rice of the TV newscast.

She also felt something in her gut: That weve lost a lot of Americans 
and that eventually we would get these people. I felt the anger. Of 
course I felt the anger.

Down in the bunker, Cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked 
planes there were. Officials feared there could be as many as 11.

As the planes track toward Washington, a discussion begins about whether 
to shoot them down. I discussed it with the president, Cheney 
recalls. Are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these 
airliners that have been hijacked? He said yes.

It was my advice. It was his decision, says Cheney.

Thats a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot 
down your own civilian aircraft, says Bush. But it was an easy 
decision to make given the  given the fact that we had learned that a 
commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. I say easy decision, it 
was, I didnt hesitate, let me put it that way. I knew what had to be 
done.

The passengers on United Flight 93 also knew what had to be done. They 
fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a Pennsylvania meadow. 
The flight was 15 minutes from Washington.

Clearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of 
government as they could: the Pentagon, perhaps the Capitol, perhaps the 
White House. These people saved us not only physically but they saved us 
psychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too, says 
Rice.

Meanwhile, Tower One was weakening. It had stood for an hour and 43 
minutes. At 10:29 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of 
its twin.

The image that went round the world reached the First Lady in a secure 
location somewhere in Washington. I was horrified, she says. I 
thought, Dear God, protect as many citizens as you can. It was a 
nightmare.

By 10:30 a.m., Americas largest city was devastated, its military 
headquarters were burning. Air force One turned west along the Gulf 
Coast.

I can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the 
consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining 
moment in the history of the United States, says President Bush. I 
didnt need any legal briefs, I didnt need any consultations, I knew we 
were at war.

Mr. Bush says the first hours were frustrating. He watched the 
horrifying pictures, but the TV signal was breaking up. His calls to 
Cheney were cutting out. Mr. Bush says he pounded his desk shouting, 
This is inexcusable; get me the vice president.

I was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says 
the president. ""Information was just flying from all directions.

Chief of staff Card brought in the reports. There was word Camp David 
had been hit. A jet was thought to be targeting Mr. Bushs ranch.

I remember hearing that the State Department might have been hit, or 
that the White House had a fire in it. So we were hearing lots of 
different information, says Card.

They also feared that Air Force One itself was a target. Cheney told the 
president there was a credible threat against the plane. Using the code 
name for Air Force One, Mr. Bush told an aide, Angel is next. The 
threat was passed to presidential pilot Colonel Mark Tillman.

It was serious before that but now it is -no longer is it a time to get 
the president home, Tillman says. We actually have to consider 
everything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to 
make sure that no one knows what our position is.

Tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while Secret 
Service agents double-checked the identity of everyone on board. The 
crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. Then came a warning from 
air traffic control  a suspect airliner was dead ahead.

Coming out of Sarasota there was one call that said there was an 
airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with, Tillman 
remembers.

Tillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal 
traffic. They were on course for Washington, but by now no one thought 
that was a good idea, except the president.

I wanted to come back to Washington, but the circumstances were such 
that it was just impossible for the Secret Service or the national 
security team to clear the way for Air Force One to come back, says 
Bush.

So Air Force One set course for an underground command center in 
Nebraska. Back in Washington, the presidents closest advisor, Karen 
Hughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to Mr. 
Bush.

And the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me, 
sounded very shaken said, Maam, Im sorry, we cant reach Air Force 
One. Hughes recalls. Hughes was out of the White House during the 
attacks. When she came back, it was a place she didnt recognize.

There were either military, or maybe Secret Service, dressed all in 
black, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. And I never expected to 
see something like that in, in our nation's capital, says Hughes.

When she walked into the White House, no one was inside. I knew it was 
a day that you didn't want to surprise anybody, and so I yelled, 
Hello? and two, again, kind of SWAT team members came running, running 
through the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to 
the location where I met the vice president.

On Air Force One, Col. Tillman had a problem. He needed to hide the most 
visible plane in the world, a 747 longer than the White House itself. He 
didnt want to use his radio, because the hijackers could be listening 
to air traffic control. So he called air traffic control on the 
telephone.

We actually didn't tell them our destination or what directions we were 
heading, says Tillman. We, we basically just talked to 'em and said, 
'OK, fine, we have no clearance at this time, we are just going to fly 
across the United States.'

Controllers passed Air Force One from one sector to another, warning 
each other to keep the route secret.

OK, wheres he going? one tower radioed to another.

Just watch him, a second tower responded. Dont question him wheres 
he's going. Just work him and watch him, theres no flight plan in and 
were not going to put anything in. Ok, sir?

Air Force One ordered a fighter escort, and air traffic control radioed 
back: Air Force One, got two F-16s at about your 10 oclock position.

The staff, and the president and us, were filed out along the outside 
hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows, 
says Bartlett. And the president gives them a signal of salute, and the 
pilot kind of tips his wing, and fades off and backs into formation.

The men in the F-16s were Shane Brotherton and Randy Roberts, from the 
Texas Air National Guard. Their mission was so secret their commander 
wouldnt tell them where they were going.

He just said, 'Youll know when you see it,' and that was my first 
clue, I didnt have any idea what we were going up until that point, 
says Brotherton. He knew when he saw it.

We, we were trying to keep an 80-mile bubble, bubble around Air Force 
One, and we'd investigate anything that was within 80 miles, says 
Roberts.

Bush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this 
aircraft, or for his own safety: I looked out the airplane and saw two 
F-16s on each wing. It was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to 
get us.

We now know that the threat to Air Force One was part of the fog of war, 
a false alarm. But it had a powerful effect at the time. Some wondered, 
with the president out of sight, was he still running the government? He 
hadnt appeared after the attack on Washington. Mr. Bush was clearly 
worried about it. At one point he was overheard saying, The American 
people want to know where their dang president is. The staff considered 
an address to the nation by phone but instead Mr. Bush ordered Air Force 
One to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on TV. At 
11:45 a.m., they landed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

The resolve of our great nation is being tested. But make no mistake, 
we will show the world that we will pass this test. God bless, Bush 
said to the nation from Barksdale.

At Barksdale, the Secret Service believed the situation in Washington 
was still unsafe. So the plane continued on to Nebraska, to the command 
center where Mr. Bush would be secure and have all the communications 
gear he needed to run the government. Aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush had 
a job for press secretary Fleischer.

The president asked me to make sure that I took down everything that 
was said. I think he wanted to make certain that a record existed, says 
Fleischer

Fleischers notes capture Mr. Bushs language, plain and unguarded. To 
the vice president he said: Were at war, Dick, were going to find out 
who did this and kick their ass. Another time, Mr. Bush said, Were 
not going to have any slap-on-the-wrist crap this time.

The President adds, I can remember telling the Secretary of Defense, I 
said, Were going to find out who did this and then Mr. Secretary, you 
and Dick Myers, who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs, are 
going to go get them.

By 3 p.m., Air Force One touched down at Offutt Air Force Base in 
Nebraska. Mr. Bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that 
gave no hint of what they would find below.

At the bottom of the stairs was the U.S. Strategic Command Underground 
Command Center. It was built to transmit a presidents order to go to 
nuclear war. But when Mr. Bush walked in, the battle staff was watching 
the skies over the United States. Many airplanes had still not landed. 
After a short briefing, Mr. Bush and Card were taken to a teleconference 
center which connected them to the White House, the Pentagon, the FBI 
and the CIA. Mr. Bush had a question for his CIA Director George Tenent.

According to Rice, Bush asked Tenent who had done this. Rice recalls 
that Tenent answered: Sir, I believe its al Qaeda. Were doing the 
assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al Qaeda.

The evidence would build. FBI Director Robert Mueller says that an 
essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed.

A flight attendant on American Flight 11, Amy Sweeney, had the presence 
of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the 
seat numbers of the hijackers. That was the first piece of hard 
evidence. We could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in 
those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those 
individuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and 
going through a process of elimination, says Mueller.

In Nebraska, the White House staff was preparing for an address to the 
nation from the Air Force bunker, but by then the president had had 
enough. He decided to come back.

At one point, he said he didnt want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him 
out of Washington, Fleischer says. That verbatim.

On board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world: 
I had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. One was that 
you're guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because I knew these terrorists 
like al-Qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. The 
other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition 
of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists.

As Air Force One sped east, the last casualty of the attack on America 
collapsed, one of the nations worst days wore into evening. At the 
World Trade Center, 2,801 were killed; at the Pentagon, 184; and in 
Pennsylvania 40. Altogether, there were 3,025 dead.

Anybody who would attack America the way they did, anybody who would 
take innocent life the way they did, anybody who's so devious, is evil, 
Bush said recently.

Mr. Bush would soon see that evil face to face. After arriving in 
Washington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the Pentagon on the 
way to the White House.

Was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a White 
House to return to? I dont remember thinking about whether or not the 
White House would have been obliterated,"" he recalls. ""I think I might 
have thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to 
take our best shot.

Mr. Bush arrived back at the White House nine hours after the attacks. 
His next step was an address to the nation. Karen Hughes and her staff 
were already working on the speech.

He decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was 
reassurance, remembers Hughes. We had to show resolve, we had to 
reassure people, we had to let them know that we would be OK.

Just off the Oval Office, Mr. Bush added the words that would become 
known as the Bush Doctrine - no distinction between terrorists and those 
who harbor them. The staff wanted to add a declaration of war but Mr. 
Bush didnt think the American people wanted to hear it that night and 
he was emphatic about that.

He prepared to say it from the same desk where Franklin Roosevelt first 
heard the news of Pearl Harbor. Now Bush was commander in chief. Eighty 
million Americans were watching.

Today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under 
attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts, he said 
from the Oval Office that night.

The Oval Office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in American 
history since the Civil War. Before he walked to the White House 
residence for the night, Mr. Bush dictated these words for the White 
House daily log: The Pearl Harbor of the 21st century took place today. 
We think it's Osama bin Laden.

(CBS)When Sept. 12 dawned, President Bush was demanding a war plan. No 
one in the White House or the Pentagon could be sure of what the 
president would do. In office for just eight months, hed never been 
tested as commander-in-chief.

I never asked them what they thought, President Bush said of the 
Pentagon brass, because I didnt really  because I knew what I was 
gonna do. I knew exactly what had to be done, Scott. And that was to set 
a strategy to seek justice. Find out who did it, hunt them down and 
bring them to justice.

In the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next: The 
deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against 
our country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war, he 
said.

To the war cabinet, al Qaeda was no surprise. National Security Advisor 
Condoleezza Rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to 
strike bin Ladens organization well before Sept. 11.

The president said, You know Im tired of swatting at flies, I need a 
strategy to eliminate these guys, Rice recalls.

In one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the CIA and FBI didnt 
pick up clues that an attack in the United States was imminent. Without 
a sense of urgency, the White House strategy the president had asked for 
came too late.

Chief of Staff Andrew Card recalls that the plan Mr. Bush had asked for 
was literally headed to the presidents desk, I think, on the eleventh, 
tenth or eleventh, of September.

On Sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options - 
who to hit and how to hit them. There were some at the Pentagon who 
worried in the early hours that Mr. Bush would order up an immediate 
cruise missile strike, of the kind that had not deterred bin Laden in 
the past.

Well, theres a lot of nervous Nellies at the Pentagon, anyway, Mr. 
Bush tells Pelley. A lot of people like to chatter, you know, more than 
they should. But no, I appreciate that very much. Secretary of Defense 
(Donald) Rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what 
we called boots on the ground. That if youre gonna go to war, then 
youve gotta go to war with all your assets.

The president says he wanted to fight and win a guerilla war with 
conventional means.

It was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by CIA Director 
George Tenent. Tenent wanted to combine American technology and 
intelligence with the brute force of Afghan fighters hostile to the 
Taliban government.

Secretary of State Colin Powell, noting that the CIA had already 
developed a long relationship with the Afghan resistance, called it an 
unconventional solution to an unconventional problem.

As I like to describe it to my friends, Powell says, we had on the 
ground a Fourth World army riding horses and living in tents with some 
CIA and special forces with them and we had a First World air force, the 
best in the world. How do you connect it all?

The president gave them 48 hours to figure it out.

Meanwhile, Mr. Bush went to the battlefield himself. Just the day 
before, he had called the Pentagon the mightiest building in the 
world. Now one-fifth of it was in ruins. The wreckage of American 
Flight 77 was being examined by Navy investigators. And before Mr. Bush 
left, he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering 
the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch.
The next day, Sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the 
public never heard about. Threats had been were coming in constantly but 
this one sounded credible: a large truck bomb headed to the White House. 
The Secret Service wanted the president back in the bunker.

He wasnt real receptive to that, to that recommendation, remembers 
Brian Stafford, director of the Secret Service. And he ordered a 
hamburger and said he was going to stay in the White House that evening 
and thats what he did.

The next day, would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the 
president. On Friday, Sept. 14, Mr. Bush started the day with a cabinet 
meeting, but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause.

He sat down, slightly overcome, for a moment but he recaptured it, 
says Powell who remembers being worried that the president might have 
trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service 
later that morning.

And I just scribbled a little note to him, Powell recalls, and I 
said, Mr. President, Ive learned over the years when you are going to 
give a very emotional speech, watch out for certain words that will 
cause you to start to tear up. He looked at me and he smiled and then 
at the next break in the conversation he said, The Secretary of State 
told me not to break down at the memorial service, and that broke the 
tension and everybody started laughing and I felt embarrassed.

First Lady Laura Bush was involved in planning the memorial service and 
she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting. I wanted 
the Psalms and everything to be read to be comforting, because I think 
we were a country, that needed, everyone of us, needed comforting.

It also stirred the mourners resolve, as Rice remember. As we stood to 
sing the Battle Hymn of the Republic, she says, you could feel the 
entire congregation and I could certainly feel myself stiffen, the kind 
of spine, and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve.

We all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had 
been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what 
had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually 
going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again.

Next came a visit to ground zero. The president was not prepared for 
what he encountered there.

You couldnt brief me, you couldnt brief anybody on ground zero until 
you saw it,"" Mr. Bush says. It was like  it was ghostly. Like youre 
having a bad dream and youre walking through the dream.

The president found the scene very powerful, particularly when the men 
and women at ground zero began to chant, USA! USA!.

There was a lot of bloodlust, the president recalls. People were, you 
know, pointing their big old hands at me saying, Dont you ever forget 
this, Mr. President. Dont let us down. The scene was very powerful. 
Very powerful.

When Mr. Bush tried to speak, the crowd kept shouting, We cant hear 
you.

The president responded, I can hear you. I can hear you. The rest of 
the world hears you. And the people who knocked these buildings down 
will hear all of us soon.

Mr. Bush had been in New York just a few weeks before; hed posed with 
the firemen who always stood by whenever the presidents helicopter 
landed there. Now, five of the men who stood with the president in the 
picture were dead  lost at ground zero.

When the president arrived Sept. 14, Manhattan was papered with the 
faces of the lost. Families, unable to believe that so many had vanished 
in an instant, held onto the hope that their loved ones were just 
missing. It was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother.

At a meeting the public never saw, the president spoke with several 
hundred of these families in a convention hall.

People said to me, Hell come out. Dont worry, Mr. president, well 
see him soon. I know my loved one, he will - hell find a place to 
survive underneath the rubble and well get him out. I, on the other 
hand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and 
cry, but I remember the whole time thinking, This is incredibly sad 
because the loved ones wont come out.

One little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his 
firefighter uniform and as he signed it, Mr. Bush remembers, he told the 
boy, Your daddy wont believe that I was here, so you show him that 
autograph.

It was an effort to provide a little hope, the president recalls. I 
still get emotional thinking about it because were dealing with people 
who loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved theirwives who loved 
their husbands. It was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for 
all of us because we were a very emotional, and I was emotional at 
times. I felt, I felt the same now as I did then, which is sad. And I 
still feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my 
tears, I see opportunity.

The president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes; 
he stayed for two and a half hours. It was there he met Arlene Howard. 
The body of her son, George, was among the first to be found at ground 
zero.

I called the police department, Howard remembers,  and they said he 
hadnt called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and I said, 
No, I dont need to call back. If he hadnt called in, I knew where he 
was.

George Howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 
when the World Trade Center was bombed. He had been off duty that day, 
and he was off duty on Sept. 11, but couldnt stay away. The police 
department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president.

He (the president) he leaned over to talk to me, Howard recalls. And 
he extends his sympathy to me and thats when I asked him Id like to 
present Georges shield to him in honor of all the men and women who 
were killed over there.

By the end of that day, Mr. Bush flew to Camp David visibly drained.

He was physically exhausted, he was mentally exhausted, he was 
emotionally exhausted, he was spiritually exhausted, recalls Card..

The next day  Saturday, Sept. 15 - Mr. Bush met members of his war 
cabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting.

My message is for everybody who wears the uniform  get ready. The 
United States will do what it takes, Mr. Bush told them.

As Powell remembers it, He was encouraging us to think boldly. He was 
listening to all ideas; he was not constrained to any one idea; he 
wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other.

President Bush was pleased with the progress that had been made. On the 
other hand, he says, I wanted to clarify plans and I went around the 
room and I asked everybody what they thought ought to happen.

When he left that meeting on Saturday night, he still had not told the 
cabinet what he was planning.

I wanted to just think it through, Mr. Bush remembers. Any time you 
commit troops to harms way, a president must make sure that he fully 
understands all the consequences and ramifications. And I wanted to just 
spend some time on it alone. And did.

What were his reservations?

Mr. Bush says, Could we win? I didnt want to be putting our troops in 
there unless I was certain we could win. And I was certain we could win.

Nine days after the attacks on America, before a joint session of 
Congress the president committed the nation to the war on terror.

Each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it 
happened, Mr. Bush told the Congress and the nation. Well remember 
the moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. Some 
will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. Some will carry 
memories of a face and a voice gone forever. And I will carry this. It 
is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World 
Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, 
Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that 
ended and a task that does not end.

A year has passed since then, but the president says his job is still to 
remind Americans of what happened and of the war that is still being 
waged, a war he reminds himself of every day in the Oval Office, 
literally keeping score, one terrorist at a time.

In his desk, the president says, I have a classified document that 
might have some pictures on there, just to keep reminding me about whos 
out there, where they might be

And as the terrorists are captures or killed? I might make a little 
check there, yeah, Mr. Bush admits.

But there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list  
Osama bin Laden.

(CBS)A lot has happened in the year since Sept. 11. One year ago, the 
president was new on the job, with little experience in foreign policy. 
He had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements. Now, 
on his orders, U.S. forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did 
not expect, in a world completely changed. In the Oval Office last week, 
CBS News Correspondent Scott Pelley asked the president about Iraq, 
about whether Americans are safe at home and about Osama bin Laden.
------------------------------------------------------------------------


Scott Pelley: You must be frustrated, maybe angry. After a year, we 
still dont have Osama Bin Laden?

President Bush: How do you know that? I dont know whether Osama bin 
Laden is dead or alive. I dont know that. Hes not leading a lot of 
parades. And hes not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he 
was. This is much bigger than one person anyway. This is  were slowly 
but surely dismantling and disrupting the al Qaeda network that, that 
hates America. And we will stay on task until we complete the task. I 
always knew this was a different kind of war, Scott. See, in the old 
days, you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his 
tanks or his airplanes and his ships. This is an international manhunt. 
Were after these people one at the time. Theyre killers. Period.

Pelley: But have you won the war before you find Osama bin Laden dead or 
alive?

Mr. Bush: If he were dead, theres somebody else to replace him. And we 
would find that person. But slowly but surely, we will dismantle the al 
Qaeda network. And those who sponsor them and those who harbor them. And 
at the same time, hopefully lay the seeds for, the conditions necessary 
so that people dont feel like theyve got to conduct terror to achieve 
objectives.

Pelley: Do you look back on the Afghan campaign with any doubts? 
Certainly, weve overthrown the Taliban government. Certainly, al Qaeda 
has been scattered. But some of the Taliban leaders appear to have 
gotten away. And there have been many civilian casualties as well.

Mr. Bush: Uh huh. Well, you know, I am sad that civilians lost their 
life. But I understand war. We did everything we can to  everything we 
could to protect people. When civilians did die, it was because of a 
mistake. Certainly not because of intention. We liberated a country for 
which Im extremely proud. No,  I dont second guess things. Its  
things never go perfect in a time of war.

Pelley: Are you committed to ending the rule of Saddam Hussein?

Mr. Bush: Im committed to regime change.

Pelley: There are those who have been vocal in their advice against war 
in Iraq. Some of our allies in the Gulf War, Saudi Arabia, Turkey for 
example. Even your fathers former national security advisor, Mr. 
Scowcroft has written about it in the paper. What is it in your 
estimation that they dont understand about the Iraq question that you 
do appreciate?

Mr. Bush: The policy of the government is regime change, Scott, hasnt 
changed. I get all kinds of advice. Im listening to the advice. I 
appreciate the consultations. And well consult with a lot of people but 
our policy hasnt changed.

Pelley: On Air Force One you described the terrorists as evil.

Mr. Bush: Yeah.

Pelley: I dont think anyone would disagree with that, but at the same 
time, many in the Arab world are angry at the United States for 
political reasons because of our policy in Israel or our troops in the 
oil region of the Middle East. Is there any change in foreign policy 
that youre considering that might reduce Arab anger against the United 
States.

Mr. Bush: Hmm. Well, Im working for peace in the Middle East. Im the 
first president that ever went to the United Nations and publicly 
declared the need to have a Palestinian state living side-by-side with 
Israel in peace. Ive made it clear that in order for there to be peace 
the Palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror 
and believes in peaces and quits using the Palestinian people as pawns. 
I've also made it clear to the other Arab nations in the region that 
theyve got responsibilities. If you want peace they gotta work toward 
it. Were more than willing to work for it, but they have to work for it 
as well. But all this business isnt going to happen as long as a few 
are willing to blow up the hopes of many. So we all gotta work to fight 
off terror.

Pelley: Arafat has to go?

Mr. Bush: Either, hes, hes been a complete failure as far as I am 
concerned. Utter disappointment.

Pelley: There has been some concern over the year about civil liberties.

Mr. Bush: Yeah

Pelley: In fact, an appeals court recently was harsh about your 
administrations decision to close certain deportation hearings. They 
said, quote, A government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to 
the Constitution. Where do you draw the line sir?

Mr. Bush: I draw the line at the Constitution. We will protect America. 
But we will do so on, within the guidelines of the Constitution, 
confines of the Constitution, spirit of the Constitution.

Pelley: Is there anything that the Justice Department has brought to you 
as an idea that youve thought, No, thats too far. I dont wanna go""

Mr. Bush: Nah, not that that I remember. And I am pleased with the 
Justice Department. I think that Attorney Generals doing a fine job, by 
the way...and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure 
that they review decisions we make, I think thats fine. I mean, thats 
good. Its healthy. Its part of America.

Pelley: Franklin Roosevelt said that America should stand in defense of 
four freedoms. Freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want 
and freedom from fear. Do we have that today Mr. President? Freedom from 
fear?

Mr. Bush: I think more than we did, in retrospect. The fact that we are 
on alert, the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us 
more free from fear than on that fateful day of September the 11th. 
Weve got more work to do.

Pelley: And Americans should not live their lives in fear?

Mr. Bush: I dont think so. No. I think Americans oughta know their 
governments doing everything possible to help. And obviously if we get 
information that relates directly a particular attack well deal with 
it. And if we get noise that deals with a general attack, well alert 
people. There are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny 
and run down leads. And the American people need to go about their 
lives. It seems like they are."

Please, please, don't do this.

In 4.4, kmail depends on mysql-server in order to send mail. (kmail -> Akon=

					&nbsp;
					
						Dear Readers,
						So far, 2002 has been a year marked with variations on earlier
worms. If you update your antivirus software on a regular basis,
these new versions of Frethem and Yaha shouldn't be a nuisance.
But if you haven't updated in a while, these variants--plus the
continuing threat of Klez.h--should motivate you. In security
news, a flaw in certain versions of PGP encryption could affect
Outlook users. Read on to learn whether you're vulnerable.
 
						&nbsp;
					
					
				
				
				
			

			
			
			

	
	
	
		
	
	



			








Frethem.k worm wants to give you a password
 An e-mail message that promises to reveal secret information with
a password is yet another variant from the pesky Frethem worm
family. Frethem.k, technically known as w32.frethem.k@mm, also
called Frethem.l by some vendors, uses its own SMTP engine to
send e-mail using addresses obtained from infected systems. This
worm does not carry a destructive payload. Mac and Linux users
are not affected.



Yaha.e screensaver worm spreading
 The Yaha.e mass-mailing worm masquerades as a friendly
screensaver, proving that users worldwide are still opening
attached files from total strangers. Yaha.e (w32.yaha.e@mm, also
known as Lentin.e, Yaha.f, and Yaha.g) is a successful variant of
a worm first seen around Valentine's Day this year. Thankfully,
this worm does not affect Mac, Linux, or Unix users.







Leaky PGP Outlook plug-in 
PGP 7.03 and 7.04, widely used plug-ins for Microsoft's Outlook
e-mail client, inadvertently weakens security and leaves the mail
program open to attack. Fortunately, there is a patch available.




Are Web-based e-mail accounts less virus-prone than Outlook?
>Is it true that if I use a Web-based e-mail service such as 
>Yahoo I'll be safe from Outlook-related viruses? --Charles M.

No. Many new viruses do not require a PC-based e-mail client such
as Outlook in order to spread. These new viruses, including 
Klez, have their own e-mail client (SMTP) and can find e-mail
addresses within cached Web pages on an infected machine,
bypassing the need to use Outlook's Address Book. Larger
Web-based e-mail services, such as Hotmail and Yahoo Mail, screen
mail hosted on their sites for viruses, but there's no beating
having a good antivirus product on your desktop just in case.

Good. I actually looking at `yes` but I was in
slow mode on Friday and didn't consider combining with `head`

To remove newlines then handiest is: tr -d '\n'

Put the commands in .gnomerc (for GNOME only) or .xsessionrc (for all X
sessions). If you want to start graphical applications, put the
appropriate .desktop files in ~/.config/autostart, or use the GNOME
session manager for the purpose. As others have pointed out, the file
.xsession should be reserved for starting an X session.

Uh? No, there are many problems coming for different sources that can 
affect the browser stability.

Javascript (and flash as well as other plugins) can be one of them, sure, 
but disabling it should cure the issue at all. If it does not, that means 
the problem can lie somewhere (packaging error, xul library or even old 
profile settings).

But ""closing tags and getting crash randomly"" is not the type of 
behaviour I would associate to a javascript issue becasue javascript code 
should have been rendered when the page loads or when clicking on items, 
but not at page/tab close :-?

A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. 

The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
card said nothing but ""Maxwell House"".  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till 
the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. 

The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
and the card read: ""Benson & Hedges"".  Mom now knew to go straight to 
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
""Extra Long, King Size"".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
happy for her daughter. 

The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"".  Mom took out her latest 
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: ""Three times a 
day, seven days a week, both ways."" 

Mom fainted."

657,"business intentDear Sir,

I am Stanley Woodwork, the secetary of Africa White farmers
co-operation (AWFC) OF Zimbabwe. After the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president Mr. Robert Mugabe won the presidential election, the
government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme. This programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white African farmers for redistribution to black africans. This programme has attracted worldwide
condemnation from world leaders including British prime minister,mr Tony Blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of
victimization and physical abuse.
   Two weeks ago, our headquartes in Harare was attacked and
looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building. Fortunately,they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which
belong to the co-operation. This cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government.
   Now I have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe. The cash in question is US$46Million dollars.
   Once I can get your commitment and sincerity of investing
this funds on our behalf then I would proceed to get the funds freighted to Europe, where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us.
   You do not have anything to worry about as I would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe, and the business proposal is 100% legal and risk free.
   You would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe.
Please get back to me if you can be of assistance and I would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government.
   I expect 100% confidentiality and your prompt response to
this mail so as to proceed.you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork@email.com


Kind regards,

Stanley Woodwork."

You can't, because there isn't one, yet.  Habeas is using a 
combination of copyright and trademark law to protect their 
sender warranties.  They hope to patent the system, but they 
have not been ISSUED a patent.

act.DTL

Opening arguments are set to begin early next month in Eldred vs. Ashcroft,
a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyright
law, including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work of
others.

....

To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internet
bookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that will
bring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,
before arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,
libraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free
high-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are
already in the public domain.

--------

I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and
saw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a
small satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding
machine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a
copy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total
fixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA
had the equipment donated) is under $10k.

One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if
they wished, add these ""virtual holdings"" (public domain materials) to their
existing library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be
compelling to small libraries in remote areas.

That's another argument for a ""HLL"" (Habeas Licensee List) which would be less
inclusive than a test for the mark of for HIL, but more timely and accurate. When an
ip address is on the HLL it could get a huge negative score, bigger than the Habeas
mark alone.

This is so true.
When I looked at establishing AppleUsers.org, as a central location of  
resources for Australian User Groups, I thought long and hard about  
the name I was going to call the group... and I deliberately steered  
clear of using Mac or Macintosh in the name... as I was aware that  
Apple provides more than that product.

Also Apple themselves have never referred to User Groups as Macintosh  
User Groups... the official logo they provide actually says Apple User  
Group

Mind you MUG sounds better as an acronym then AUG does :)

Apple has saved itself... and as much as I believe User Groups did a  
far better job of keeping the Apple Flag visible back in the '90's  
then Apple itself did, that is no longer the case in the 21st Century

I agree that User Groups are now basically fan clubs... or social  
groups that are bought together through a common interest of the  
devices and software that one company produces.

But I disagree that a User Group can't be a ""for profit"" enterprize...  
as there are groups out there that are exactly that - look at some of  
the Final Cut Pro groups as a perfect example that works extremely  
well under a ""for profit"" arrangement.

As others have mentioned, could you have chosen a better analogy than  
Hannah Montana :)
but the point you are making is quite correct.

I have friends who are involved with Local Historical Societies, Model  
Train (and even real ones) Appreciation Societies, and even reptile  
keepers who get together to discuss raising of snakes, lizards etc...  
they don't expect that one single company owes them anything to help  
them exist or to function.  Apple User Groups should look at how some  
other 'social', 'hobby' and 'fan' clubs work.

Every group that I have seen take that attitude isn't around anymore,

Whilst I strongly advise all User Groups that they need to EVOLVE,  
they don't need to be reactionary with changes. Evolution is a gradual  
change.

And whilst every group needs new members to survive, let alone expand,  
we have to remember that Marketing 101 theorem that it is often easier  
to retain an existing customer then it is to get a new one.

So don't suddenly alienate your existing membership, but rather help  
lead them

Apple's own 'Think Different' marketing strategy is STILL in place at  
Apple today, even if you don't hear it been said... there is no other  
way they could have produced the iPhone and iPad without embracing  
this philosophy.

User Groups need to do the same

There are still places for newsletters and Discs of the Month, even in  
the 21st century... but again they need to be thought about  
differently... and form part of an overall strategy of attracting the  
same sort of customers that Apple themselves now target.

Then again, Apple itself isn't exactly democratic in the way it  
appoints its' own board. The Board itself effectively nominates itself  
and then shareholders ratify those nominations.... usually for the  
Board as a block and not for individual nominees.

And shareholders certainly don't get a say in the day to day  
management of the company nor the projects that Apple work on and  
eventually bring to market or even kill off before they get to market!

I've had other weird problems with the collection (like missing albums) 
after an upgrade of Amarok. This was due to database corruption, and the fix

Intel also had a similar device a couple of years ago (Netstructure).  They have, afaik, abandoned it.

Intel is still in the XML hardware game though.  On 8/19 they spun off a company named Tarari.   Tarari develops hardware to check the headers of IP packets. Tarari calls

Sure, but soft links would do the same. To be honest, I'm trying to

immediately obvious to everyone.

I just have tested with Lenny and seems to be working fine (Connect to 
server → ftp w/login). That creates a new network place I can connect to.

After that, I open the FTP session by providing credentials and copy a 
local file to remote FTP location and is stored fine, no error message or 
something that indicates the PUT operation has failed. 

Then, if I connect from another dedicated FTP client, I can see the new 
file there, so all looks good. 

Have you tested with another FTP server?

P.S. AFAIK, I don't have installed ""gvfs-fuse"".

The Bug Count Also Rises


by John Browne
(Imitation Hemingway Contest Winner)

In the fall of that year the rains fell as usual and washed the leaves 
of the dust and dripped from the leaves onto the ground. The shuttles 
drove through the rainy streets and took the people to meetings, then 
later brought them back, their tires spraying the mist into the air.

Many days he stood for a long time and watched the rain and the shuttles 
and drank his double-tall mochas. With the mochas he was strong.

Hernando who worked down the hall and who was large with microbrews came 
to him and told him that the ship day was upon them but the bugs were 
not yet out. The bugs which were always there even when you were in 
Cafes late at night sipping a Redhook or a double-tall mocha and you 
thought you were safe but they were there and although Enrico kept the 
floor swept clean and the mochas were hot the bugs were there and they 
ate at you.

When Hernando told him this he asked how many bugs. ""The RAID is huge 
with bugs,"" Hernando said. ""The bugs are infinite.""

""Why do you ask me? You know I cannot do this thing anymore with the bugs.""

""Once you were great with the bugs,"" Hernando said. ""No one was 
greater,"" he said again. ""Even Prado.""

""Prado? What of Prado? Let Prado fix the bugs.""

Hernando shrugged. ""Prado is finished. He was gored by three Sev 2's in 
Chicago. All he does now is drink herb tea and play with his screensavers.""

""Herb tea?""

""It is true, my friend."" Hernando shrugged again. Later he went to his 
office and sat in the dark for a long time. Then he sent e-mail to Michaels.

Michaels came to him while he was sipping a mocha. They sat silently for 
awhile, then he asked Michaels, ""I need you to triage for me.""

Michaels looked down. ""I don't do that anymore,"" he said.

""This is different. The bugs are enormous. There are an infinity of bugs.""

""I'm finished with that,"" Michaels said again. ""I just want to live 
quietly.""

""Have you heard Prado is finished? He was badly gored. Now he can only 
drink herb tea.""

""Herb tea?"" Michaels said.

""It is true,"" he said sorrowfully.

Michaels stood up. ""Then I will do it, my friend,"" he said formally. ""I 
will do it for Prado, who was once great with the bugs. I will do it for 
the time we filled Prado's office with bouncy balls, and for the time 
Prado wore his nerf weapons in the marketing hall and slew all of them 
with no fear and only a great joy at the combat. I will do it for all 
the pizza we ate and the bottles of Coke we drank.""

Together they walked slowly back, knowing it would be good. As they 
walked the rain dripped softly from the leaves, and the shuttles carried 
the bodies back from the meetings.

You got the output of 'show databases'. You then consider it a shell
command and try to excute it. Why would you want to do that? What do you
want to do with that output?

BTW: I would suggest that you actually use a .my.cnf to hold the

um.. http://wwws.sun.com/software/star/gnome/ integrated into solaris.

Of course then there's http://wwws.sun.com/software/solaris/freeware/ for 
solaris 9 which gives you afterstep and windowmaker among other stuff. My 
personal favourite at the moment is enlightenment which also has Solaris 
packages available for download.

Out of curiosity, does `normal fashion` mean that you still have to do the 
interactive customisations or is it like Solaris jumpstart where you can 
specify everything on the install server, do `boot net - install` go home, and 
come in to a fully installed and patched desktop the next morning?

I don't see why this should be a _major problem. The prom (ie the ""ok"" prompt) 
is almost at the hardware level and hence dosent depend on the os so you 
should be able to connect to that easily enough. Once the machine is installed 
cant you just log in over the network? The network is the computer after all 
(sorry couldn't resist!)

hmm... I'm not familiar with wyse stuff, but I only need to use the console 
when something breaks, then anything capable of something basic like vt100 at 
9600 8n1 seems to work  . Not sure why you'd need to worry about this much 
really, just set up jumpstart to install automatically then you don't need to 
look at the console at all.

to it. Having got it up, I want to copy the DVD to a disk on it so I have it 
handy for installing any further bits I might require. So I simply mounted 
the NFS exported DVD on the new box and started copying. 

After a couple of minutes I looked - it was transferring about 8MB a MINUTE. 
So I killed that and used rsync instead which is ticking away now at about 
100 MB/min - still not exactly turbo charged but a lot better than the NFS

at a loss I must say.

Thanks Clive. Your post has been invaluable in fixing some faulty thinking
on my part, and in provoking other useful posts. But I want more ...

The errors that I am experiencing are all similar. The first
indication of a problem is a message from the kernel (I think). An
example is:

kernel: [78454.939948] journal commit I/O error

This appears on all xterm windows on the affected machine. On the
xterm that is controlling a process that is using one of the USB
drives, there follows a long sequence of error messages about the
drive being read-only, which stops after a while. Or sometimes I stop
it by typing ^C on that xterm. 

When this happens, all the USB drives (3 of them) disappear from
/dev/disks/by-label (they are all labeled by me). I have not
discovered any to make them re-appear, short of rebooting the
computer. After reboot, I run e2fsck on all of them, and always get a
longish delay on each while e2fsck commits (or whatever) the
journal. This can take a few seconds or up to half a minute. Then
I manually mount them using pmount, and all data upto the point
where the crash happened seems to be present. 

I have installed smartmontools, but I think there is some
incompatibility between the installed version and the installed
docs. The README.Debian makes reference to editing some lines in the
config file that are not present in the default, package installed,
config file. There is (apparently) some incompatibility between using
the daemon and using smartctl. The problem host is running Lenny, but
the docs seem to be the same as on a different host that is running
Squeeze. 

I would very much appreciate some help in understanding the docs.
What is a safe thing for a nubie to type as a first command to
smartctl?

Some caveats (in decending order of concern):

1. These messages could end up being falsely (or incorrectly) reported
   to Razor, DCC, Pyzor, etc.  Certain RBLs too.  I don't think the
   results for these distributed tests can be trusted in any way,
   shape, or form when running over a public corpus.

2. These messages could also be submitted (more than once) to projects
   like SpamAssassin that rely on filtering results submission for GA
   tuning and development.

3. Spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off
   filters.  And, of course, there's always progression in technology
   (by both spammers and non-spammers).

The second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsa
signature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format used
by SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 or
SHA-1 of each file).

The third problem doesn't really worry me.

These problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are unique
to spam filtering.  Compression corpuses and other performance-related
corpuses have their own set of problems, of course.

In other words, I don't think there's any replacement for having
multiple independent corpuses.  Finding better ways to distribute
testing and collate results seems like a more viable long-term solution
(and I'm glad we're working on exactly that for SpamAssassin).  If
you're going to seriously work on filter development, building a corpus
of 10000-50000 messages (half spam/half non-spam) is not really that
much work.  If you don't get enough spam, creating multi-technique
spamtraps (web, usenet, replying to spam) is pretty easy.  And who
doesn't get thousands of non-spam every week?  ;-)

Heheheh... So becomming a university professor was your second career

Seriously though (or not, as the case may be), The Amazing Spiderman had 
many other abilities to help him out. Most notable, perhaps, was his 
'spidey strength' and 'spidey senses'. The strength to weight ratio of a 
spider is so high that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city 
blocks with little effort. His endurance is similarly enhanced as well.

As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK not 
really well explained in the comic series. Spiders have multiple eyes, 
ears, noses and tongues which Peter Parker did not visibly have. There 
have been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes, from the 
biological to hidden methamphetamine use, but none seem to do the spidey 
sense justice... I seem to recall Spiderman being able to detect the 
presence of well concealed weapons and even sense evil-doers while they 
were in their street clothes. Perhaps the spidey senses are the result 
of some sort of quantum entanglement?

Good! Your opinion of what is spam is unreliable, and therefore, I don't
*want* to trust you. IMHO, that is exactly the case that the trust system is
supposed to sort out. People who incorrectly submit non-spam bulk mail to
razor.

Then those lots of people are unreliable, and therefore will all have
minimal trust, but the people with a decent reliability and therefore trust
level will help us all...

IMHO, due to the number of messages you are sending, and the way you are
discussing TeS, (considering that you know *nothing* about it), certainly
looks like you are simply trying to throw doubt/negativity onto razor.

Personally, I haven't used razor for a few months now because I want to
integrate it into qmail-scanner *without* spam assassin, but haven't had the
time to do that, so even I can't comment on Razor at all.....

Vipul & co, I think it would be great if there was more transparency in the
whole server process, ie, if you know there is a problem, then tell all of
us, this will avoid all the stupid ""Oh, it isn't working again, and it took
me 324 days to work it out"" etc...

Just my $1 worth...

Adam

Good to know.

How come there is no link anywhere on debian.org pointing to
debian-multimedia.org? Anything to establish a chain of trust. As it is,
I looked and looked but didn't find. Even when searching for
""multimedia"" on debian.org, it does not mention debian-multimedia.org at
all. Not even when searching for ""debian-multimedia"". Every new debian
user trying to verify the credibilitiy of debian-multimedia.org would
have given up at this point for sure.

With the information that Marillat is a Debian developer (and the
precise spelling of his name) I was actually able to go to the
developer's page on debian org, find him, and see a link to d-m. So in a
very roundabout way, d-m is actually endorsed by debian.org. But how
would anybody find out about this in a reasonable amount of time?

Rendering polygons is not as easy as it used to be, the reason being the vast 
amount of different rendering techniques, methods and algorithms available. Not 
only is choosing the right ones a problem, even worse, all that are selected 
need to work together. There are some algorithms which simply do not work 
together, and in that case, only one may be used whilt the other one needs to 
be replaced witha more compatible method. This feature explores how Factor 5 
approached the problem when developing Rogue Leader for Gamecube."

    Minutes of Long Distance!
Hello ~name~,

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product or a 20 minute free trial using a local access number, your service will be operating in about 24-48 hours or on your designated trial date and time.  Please try dialing the access number you found on your reseller's web page at:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

If you ordered a flat-rate domestic calling product using a 1-800 toll-free access number, your service will be operating within 1-2 work days.

Please try dialing 1-866-865-4548.

In either case, when your service is switched on, you will hear a voice ask you to dial the number you are calling.

You must dial 1+area code+7 digit number followed by # to make any calls: local or long distance.

Example - To call www.internationalfreecall.com, you would dial the following after dialing your access number and listening for the voice:

1-410-608-8178# 

Please use this service for all your calling and you will never pay more than your monthly fee again. There are no taxes or surcharges, so dial away!

Finally, I recommend entering the access number into your speed dial settings on your telephone.  This will make your service quicker and easier to use, and thus more enjoyable.

If you have any questions, please contact us for more information.

In addition, if you need product enhancements like 3-way calling, portable calling cards, international calling products, or marketing tools, please visit:

http://www.internationalfreecall.com

In the meantime, the other network on this free calling promotion is OPEX, which is offering 100 minutes of free long distance for trying their program.  

Opex's usual rates are 4.5 cents per minute for domestic calls, with great international rates, too!

Nope, hibernating does not work with the nvidia driver, but I didn't/couldn't test it with the 
nouveau driver, since I couldn't get a login screen to begin with and Ctl+Alt+F1 didn't respond 
either, so it was unusable for me.
Had to do Ctl+Alt+SysRq+(REISUB) and boot into single user mode to get my system working again.

Desktop effects seems to be disabled by default on laptops, so that's probably not it.

I was thinking about getting all obsequious and fawning at the High

Going back to obsequious pandering is looking very tempting. Yes, us

Wishful thinking. People are just bigger dickheads now. Culture is changing
and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down
when you disagree with them.  The people that do this are NOT
disenfranchised. They
get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes. The act of protesting is
more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these
people.

And where does this end? Shouting down speakers is an obviously stupid
tactic if they are -really- interested in advocating change. Are they such
clueless social morons that they don't see this or are they just interested
in stroking their pathetic egos?

I did that.  It's still really slow when you have thousands of messages.

I hadn't tried that.  I figured it was better to find out if ""all but
one"" testing had any appreciable value.  It looks like it doesn't so
I'll forget about it.

Spammers could exploit this including a large MIME part at the beginning
of the message.  In pratice that would probably work fine.

Never.  I remember the time when I was ten years old and went down to
the fishing hole with my buddies.  This guy named Gordon had a really
huge head.  Wait, maybe that was Joe.  Well, no matter.  As I recall, it
was a hot day and everyone was tired...Human Growth Hormone...girl with

""rssflowersalignright""I've gotten to know Phil Ringalda over the last few weeks 
in all the discussions about RSS 2.0, and I like him, and would like to work 
with him in the future. I don't say that lightly. This evening he posted a note
[1] on his weblog that he was giving up trying to get RDF to make sense inside 
RSS. As I read his essay I could feel two-plus years of exhaustion overwhelm 
me. I found myself writing a comment after his essay saying, among other things 
""RSS is not a brilliant format. It is a compromise. It is for syndicating news 
feeds. That's all it is for, for the 18,000th time."" It's time for RDF to pack 
its bags and leave. RSS deserves some dignity, as does RDF. Emphatically, once 
and for all, they are not the same thing. Peace be with you RDF. Leave RSS 
alone. Thank you.

So you don't like the dependency to Akonadi? Too bad. As can be read on many places, Akonadi is 
there to stay. And as you mentioned in another post, the dependency to Akonadi has been in place for 
a while now (Korganizer and KAddressBook since 4.2). So there's no way in hell you're going to have 
(upstream) support for an Akonadi-less PIM.

Or don't you like the Akonadi dependency to mysql-server? Well, it's not the full mysqld package 
anymore, but the dependency is to mysql-server-core(-5.1) (see #548419).
SQLite has been found inappropriate since it lacks proper transaction support.
PostgreSQL is apparently capable of providing the proper features and Tobias Koenig has made Akonadi 
working with PostgreSQL since the end of last year (http://tokoe-kde.blogspot.com/2009/12/akonadi-
and-postgresql.html). That patch was committed to trunk at that time, but apparently didn't make 
into SC 4.4 (?).
So if you want to use PostgreSQL, your best bet would be to port/base that patch on 4.4.

Yeah right, let's get a combination of 4.3 and 4.4 (and 4.2?) into stable, that surely must be 
preferable. And good luck getting any upstream support for bugs resulting from that.

As Ana indicated the freeze won't wait for SC 4.5, so better make the best out of 4.4.
If you want the freeze to wait for 4.5, better try to convince the release team. Good luck.

You could create a desktop shortcut of your application (and ensure the =
full URL to your JNLP is correct in it's Info.plist), wrap up the =
shortcut, and submit that. I think that would provide a more Mac-like =
experience for your customers coming from =

1585,"using samba with unix aclshi all,

I am setting up a file server for a small company. The people who will 
be using it want to be able to control who accesses particular 
directories on a user/group basis. I originally thought that it would be 
enough to set up a standard samba system with unix home directories, 
plus shares for each group of users (admin / tech etc.), but they are 
keen to have a system which allows them to make some parts of the 
filesystem available to more than one group, which as far as I know 
isn't supported by this kind of setup. (Unless I were to have shares for 
each possible combination of groups...)

I think that to achieve this I will need to set up samba with unix ACLs, 
but I'm not sure what's the best way of doing this - the two options 
seem to be using a patched kernel with an ext3 filesystem, or else using 
the XFS filesystem which has built in ACL support. Which of these would 
you recommend?

The XFS option seems a lot simpler to maintain (no need to patch the 
kernel every time an update is released), but I'm worried that because 
this filesystem is not used so much, it may not be as reliable as ext3.

Thanks for any help with this,

andy baxter, lancaster UK.

441,"ALSA (almost) made easyHi all,

I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is
that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually
testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality
people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from
that, right? ;-)

I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages
should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and
maybe others, who knows ;-)

Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :
- Recompile the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm for your running kernel
  (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)
- Install this ""alsa-driver"" package
- Install the ""alsa-libs"" package
- Install the ""alsa-utils"" package

Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your
/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/
(very complete and very good documentation!)
Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)

Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need
to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" and
insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" to
check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with
e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.

With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You
can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...
hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3
files... that's it!

It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only
thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't
imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the
/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly
%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d
structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the
default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's
development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static
libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against
which the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the
rpm release, so does the architecture!).

I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!

Download :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/

Current spec files :
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec
(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )

Matthias

PS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply
run ""xine -A alsa09"" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)

 Meaningful sentences 
 
 Tracey Lawson 
 
 
 If you ever wanted to look like ""one of the most dangerous inmates in prison
 history"", as one judge described Charles Bronson, nows your chance. Bronson -
 the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and
 fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary
 muscle power. 
 
 Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,
 has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he
 has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a
 day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at
 virtually no cost. 
 
 The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a
 fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and
 starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the
 exercise industry. 
 
 ""I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,"" is the
 opening paragraph penned by Bronson. ""Its a joke and a big con and they call
 me a criminal!"" You cant help feeling he has a point. 
 
 This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having
 already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems
 created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to
 discover creative expression while residing at Her Majestys pleasure. 
 
 Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents
 when he was sent to Barlinnie Prisons famous special unit, which aimed to
 help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to
 express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the
 murder of ""Babs"" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he
 has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was
 published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an
 award-winning film. 
 
 Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in
 Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison
 officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being
 transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and
 developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,
 a frank account of Glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received
 critical praise. 
 
 And Lord Archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books
 that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book
 deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported 10 million, and is no doubt
 scribbling away as we speak. 
 
 So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so
 destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck
 on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronsons publisher, has published many books
 about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both
 pragmatic and profound. 
 
 He says: ""Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have
 known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the
 chance to focus on their creative skills. 
 
 ""It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an
 education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time
 anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents."" 
 
 However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:
 ""Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine
 the very essence of who they are. 
 
 ""They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or
 am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something
 good?"" 
 
 Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that
 of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered
 mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed
 robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term
 over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was
 jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly
 two days during a jail siege. 
 
 Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is
 renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands
 and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: ""I can hit
 a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds."" 
 
 But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary
 Fitness might be the book which will see Bronsons face sitting on every
 coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which
 so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because
 Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. 
 
 ""All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, its just a load of
 bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,"" he writes, in what can only be
 described as a refreshingly honest style. ""We can all be fat lazy bastards,
 its our choice, Im sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff
 your face with shit you become shit, thats logical to me."" 
 
 As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside
 we all needed. 
 
 
 Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will
 be available in bookstores from October at 7.99

This is a good thing to look into. Now I am experiencing a interlude

What a load of crap. Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that 
its considerably
clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the 
common practice of
putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV 
cameras, visiting dignitaries,
etc, further exacerbating those feelings.
""Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies"" is now usually done by police 
with riot gear and pepper spray.

We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably 
strayed from the permit area,
which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance 
ministers held here (the motorcade drove
by it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and 
arrested. Not very muddied at all.

Fax No: Your Intl. Access Code + 873762692485

Lagos, Nigeria.
Dear Sir,

IMPORTANT.

After due deliberation with my colleagues, We have decided to forward to
you this business proposal. We want a reliable 
person who could assist us in the transfer the sum of Twenty Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ( 
$20,500,000 ). Via International Bank Draft Cashable in any First World
Countries.

This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contracts awarded by us
under the budget allocation to our Ministry. This 
bill has been approved for payment by the other concerned Ministries. The
contract has since been executed, 
commissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract.
We are left with the balance US$20.5M as part 
of the over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for
our own use. But under our protocol division, we 
as civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This
is why we are soliciting your assistance in this 
manner and regard .

As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your address
from adverts in the business directory . I am the 
Chief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract Award Committee ( CAC )
of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
( NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISKS and
TROUBLE from my Government. We the N.N.P.C. 
Officials involved in this deal have put in many years in service to this
Ministry. We have been exercising patience for this 
opportunity for so long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity
we cannot afford to miss.

We have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of
us and I and one of my colleagues 
involved in this deal will come to your country to arrange for our share,
upon the confirmation from you that the Certified 
International Bank Draft has been Approved and Raised in your favor.

Consequent upon your acceptance of this proposal, kindly confirm your
interest by Telephone to me, through my Direct Tel 
No: +873-762-692484. (Please Call Direct, DO NOT add my country(234) and
City(1) codes ) . Your indication by revert 
Telephone to me of your sincere and serious interest will enable me fax
you or brief you of  the PROCEDURES FOR THIS 
TRANSACTION. If my line is busy, please keep trying you will surely get
through.
NOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction please
inform us so that we can look for another reliable 
person who can assist in this respect. 

It might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this
transaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be 
discovered and business like this can not be realized without mutual
trust. This is why we have decided to trust you for this 
transaction. Be further informed that everyones interest and
security had been considered before you were contacted, so be rest assured
and feel free to go into this transaction with 
us.
But let Honesty and Trust be our watchword throughout this transaction and
your prompt reply will be highly appreciated. 
Thank you, and God bless.

Best Regards,

DR. SAMUEL  EBOKA.

If wallets were all unlimited, we'd all have all our DIMM slots maxed.  I
made the same argument as you quite some time ago in favor of 32bit Linux
for small systems such as netbooks.  I was shot down and educated on the
actual memory footprint of the x86-64 binaries, and it turns out they're not
that much larger overall, and not nearly to the size that one should need
4GB RAM on a netbook.  Most of them come with 2GB anyway, which should be
more than enough for just about all application mixes, whether one chooses a
64bit OS+apps or 32bit.

> I admit I am just knowledgeable enough to be dangerous, rather than an

Correct in that one should get 4GB on a netbook due to 64bit binary size?
Or correct that 64bit binaries are (slightly) larger than 32bit binaries?
I'd agree with you on the latter but not on the former.  Stating the case of
the former is spreading misinformation.  I attempted to shoot it down.  It
is simply not correct to recommend 4GB for the reason you stated.

> Please do not try to insult.  It is not really useful, and wastes time.

Apologies.  It wasn't meant as an insult but as an exclamation point backing
incredulity.

I wouldn't say I'm new to it, but I'm not experienced. I write little snippets 
every now and again and edit system startup files etc.

This is certainly a challenge though. I guess if I can interface dyndns.org and 
smsclient relatively simply with options you mention, I'll probably manage it.

I might also put a check in there for other protocols like http, just in case 
ping happens to be the last protocol standing when the machine or connection is 
about to keel over! (thanks to Joe in the other msg for the tip)

This was poking fun of the practice of making
up differnt types of speech with different
types of protected status.  I think the
laws specialing out hate and protected speech
are ridiculous.  The point I keep trying to make
is that there's only two types, speech and action. 
I agree, they are all speech and should be 
covered by the First Amendment, but

If hate speech is so protected, why are certain
states trying to prosecute people for it?  There's
only two answers and one of them is wrong.

  1) Because hate speech is different and needs to
     have a different level of protection dictated
     by whoever's offended at the time.
  2) It's because it's not just speech, but action.
     A action who's consequences are foreseeable by 
     any reasonable person. 

Hate speech is mislabeled.  It's really ""threat"".  I think
they let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantage
in being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and
money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY
don't like.

For now it has happened twice ... it could be that I have
installed/configured something after logging in the first time. 

What is happening permanently is that if I click the logout button the whole
desktop freezes. I have to press CTRL+ALT+F[1-6] to restart kdm

What I am missing now is also the old behavior from CTRL+ALT+DEL to get
prompt for reboot or shutdown - or whatever. Now this combination is
locking the screen. Was it adopted from newer windows?

Well, 
- kplayer was not working for DVB input.
- korganizer does not start
- kweather and kmoon are not visible (can not choose to activate), though it
states it's installed.

- ALL kde apps like kplayer/organizer and probably others start very slowly
about 20-30secs to pop up


I'm sorry but I can not test anything that fast. it will take few weeks.

I will probably test upgrading (As I said) from lenny to squeeze to sid. To
simulate an upgrade of my current system. I think this is more important.
This will take a while, so my plan for now is to see what basically works
and what not.

Thanks to all who replied.

Are there many from this list going to the LBW?

I am trying to get the thursday and friday off work to get to it.

Looking doubtful as it is very near the start of term. Bloody academic
institutes :-).

it only going to take me about 6 hours or so to get there :-(

Yes, it's definitely extra work.  The question is how much extra 
work, both up front, and then on an ongoing basis.  I know 
nothing about how the trust system is working (still waiting for 
that long-promised server code to be published), but now that 
it's been turned on, and the more info that's coming out about 
it, the more concerned I'm becoming that it's extremely easy to 
game; that the initial amount of work to set up a gaming agent 
is low, and that once it's set up, it can be ""fire and forget"" 
in terms of continuing to operate in a way that's not easy to 
distinguish from real user behavior.

> Sure, you can find a way to work almost any system, but few

> will actually take the time to game the system.

Another concern I have with the way the system might be working 
is that it might not actually require very many gamers at all to 
utterly undermine the whole system.  There are a certain number 
of possible universes where the trust system is very sensitive 
to liars, or misclassifiers of ""gray"" mail, or both.  It's not 
clear yet whether this universe is one of those or not.

You do need a certain level of accuracy though, or the filter is 
not economically worthwhile.  If you only filter 75% of spam, 
you're wasting your time.  Some people receive on the order of a 
10:1 ratio of spam:real mail -- 75% means the ratio adjusts to 
5:2 which is still shitty.  95% makes it 1:2, which is better.  
99% makes it 1:10 which is quite nice.  As the global ratio of 
spam:mail rises, this problem gets somewhat more important.  
With an order of magnitude worsening of the incoming spam:real 
ratio, 100:1, 99% effective still works OK.  75% effective is 
now really, really shitty.

Time will tell.  Time will also tell how good the system is at 
adjusting over time to gaming strategies.

SA definitely has a non-zero FP rate, and always will have.  I 
would argue that any system will have a non-zero FP rate, 
including the ""no filter"" filter -- humans make mistakes too 
sometimes!  As spammer strategies evolve over time though, I'm 
fairly sure that SA will be able to adjust and compensate.  If 
spammers figure out how to easily pollute the SpamNet trust 
system, I'm not sure how easy it'll be to replace the trust 
system with something else.

Lots of theorizing, most of it based on little data.  The key 
premises I'm worrying about though are:

1. Trust system is easy to pollute
2. Trust system is not personal, which makes the assumption that 
all honest voters agree on what constitutes spam

Razor2 seems to have been a long time in coming, apparently is 
quite resource intensive (judging by Cloudmark's fundraising 
efforts), and doesn't currently work.  It has great promise, and 
I'm hoping that once the wrinkles are worked through, it'll add 
another powerful tool in the war on spam -- I'm just concerned 
that it's getting off on the wrong foot and might not be able to 
recover.

I misunderstood it too. :-(  You said ""this"" which I took to refer to the book 
that was under discussion, rather than to refer forwards to the book you were 
about to recommend.

No, no, not at all. It may have been like that once, but today anyone
can pick it up and use it. Maintain and fix it, no, but use it until
problems arise, most certainly. And for some distros, there are much
fewer problems per usage hour than even the Big W.

Ballmer in charge 
July 18, 2002 1:01 pm PT

NO ONE KNOWS better than Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer that, as the .Net
platform evolves, the success of Microsoft depends on how well the
company coordinates its tool, server, and client strategies and how well
it communicates that vision. In an interview with InfoWorld Test Center
Director Steve Gillmor and InfoWorld Editor at Large Ed Scannell at
Microsoft Fusion 2002, Ballmer discussed the progress of .Net, changes
in the company's approach to product development, and Microsoft's
efforts to simplify product licensing and inspire trust in customers and
partners.

> Last time we talked was two years ago, at the beginning of the .Net
> era. So where are we now in the .Net evolution?

Let me start by talking about where I think we are in the XML revolution
first, and then [I will] talk about where we are with .Net. I believe
that the IT industry collectively decided over the last three or four
years that the world was going to be replatformed with XML as the key
foundation. It's not like anyone ever got together to decide this, but
it's like magnetic north, where it's been clearly indicated that
everyone is rallying around the concept. But I think the degree to which
[XML] is pervasive might still be underestimated. A lot of partners,
even at this conference, see it as b-to-b for big companies. But it is
really about the way software in general is designed. It is all about
the way security should work. Management -- everything is changed.

So to answer your direct question, two years ago I might have said the
jury is still out about whether [XML] was going to happen. We were
questioning if it was going to be a legitimate competitor to Java. But
now the world has decided to embrace [XML] as the basis for the next
generation of technology. And there are a lot of benefits that come with
it. Could it have been something other than XML? Sure it could have. It
wasn't the specific technical implementation; it is merely the fact that
it comes out of Internet standards. It has deeper semantic abilities. It
is all about interoperability and connection.

So in that context, where are we with .Net? I'll say a couple
things. No. 1, I would say we have some momentum in the market. We have
customers using the .Net product line, like Merrill [Lynch], Credit
Suisse, Marks & Spencer, CitiBank, and a variety of others. People who
are doing some things for real. I feel like the degree we are out front
is in some ways smaller and in some ways larger.

> How so?

Smaller in the sense that everyone is talking the XML talk, even Sun;
bigger in the execution sense: We've delivered. We delivered the first
batch of products that really were built XML to the core -- Visual
Studio .Net and BizTalk Server -- and we are getting traction. So I feel
good about where our execution is relative to everyone else. That is not
to say that other people aren't doing some reasonable bolt-on XML
support for the stuff they have.

> You have some heavy lifting to do to convince your customers and
> partners to follow along. What do you have to do to set the standard
> for adoption and upgrading to this next generation?

We have to present the picture that we are behaving consistently within
the framework of focusing on customer issues and customer satisfaction
and trustworthy computing, which we have articulated. Now there are some
things I would have done differently, in 20-20 hindsight. I would have
increased the focus on not just security but deployment, because a lot
of the security problems are actually deployment problems. We have the
fix, but sometimes we can't get the tools in their hands to deploy those
fixes fast enough. Licensing -- I know I would have given more time, and
there are better ways to plan around the kinds of changes we made. We
are still going to have to get smart about the full ramifications.

> Do you expect any changes to be made between now and July 31 to
> Licensing 6.0? There is a lot of push-back on this.

No, there is nothing that will happen between now and July 31. And we
will continue to learn over time what we need to do to earn our
customers' trust and earn their business. I think many of the people who
are pushing back really don't even know the new terms.

> Isn't that your fault for not educating them?

Yes, it is our fault. But you meet with plenty of customers whose
companies already have licenses, and they are saying, 'I think there's a
problem.' I don't deny there are some problems. I am sure there are some
issues we will have to work on over time.

After July 31 we are going to see what the real issues are. I was
talking to a customer at the show who was saying he thought there would
be a problem, and I told him that we just completed a deal with his
company and that he is now universally licensed and that total costs to
his company are now lower than they were before. And he said, 'Oh really?'

So we'll go through July 31. We have a lot of customers who have signed
licenses, and I am sure we are going to find some issues. My bigger
concerns today are probably not in the larger accounts, but there may be
some issues we need to address among the smaller-size companies, and we will.

> How does the .Net initiative change the way in-house client and server
> developers work together? 

What we are trying to do for the health of .Net and the health of the
company and the sanity of the people who work there and the quality of
the products we produce is to have a more orchestrated, ber-road map
of where we are going.

Now there are two things a road map can be. One is just a piece of paper
that tells what everyone is doing and records a bunch of bottom-up
plans. Or it can be something where we impose more broadly our vision
from the top. We are not going to try to get everything shared. ...
That's a path for getting everything stopped up. But at the same time we
are trying to take the top four or five things we are trying to do in
the Longhorn wave, Yukon wave, or the .Net wave and really have enough
time to have some cross-cutting discussions about how we make that happen.

Bill [Gates] is dedicated full-time to being chief software
architect. He also happens to be chairman of the company, but he spends
most of his time being chief software architect. We have a body now that
meets every month -- the SLTT [Senior Leadership Technical Team],
basically the top people involved in the product-creating strategy --
and we present and discuss the issues. Bill is driving a process for
each of these waves. For instance, [he will ask] what are the
cross-cutting scenarios that I want, and then [he will] get all the
right product groups together and bring these things in front of the SLTT.

People talk about what it takes to be a good manager, and people talk
about being a good coach and getting people to like you. In a large
organization those things are important, but at a certain level, ... the
most important thing you can do for your people to make them better is
to give them a framework where they can work in harmony with the other
people in the company. And from Bill's perspective, [this framework] is
the technical road map and the SLTT process; it is the scenarios. From
my perspective, it is the P&L [profit and loss] structure and the
multiple businesses because, given how we work, giving people a
framework that gets them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the
parts will mean we have better offerings.

> It seems the scenarios construct is really working for you. Is this an
> evolution of the solutions approach? 

I would say it is a pretty direct extrapolation from the solutions
stuff, only I think we are just getting a little more experience. I
think we use the word scenarios more often and solutions less, because
solution sounds more like a fixed thing. At the end of the day, most of
the things we do are customizable and programmable, and so people make
them into the solution they want. But they are still scenarios. What
will software deployment look like? Well, that is a scenario because it
involves Windows, Office, and other applications.

We are working hard to make sure the whole is bigger than the sum of the
parts. That's not to say people are always comfortable with this. I
can't even say we will do it perfectly. All we have to do is do it a lot
better than we had been doing it. I think that would be a big step
forward for the customers.

> Will this approach cut down on some of the technology civil wars
> Microsoft has had in the past involving who is going to gain control of
> a project? This seems to be a very democratic approach to development.

I would not use the word democracy to describe it. People have to come
together and ultimately make some decisions. This is not a voting
process here, the agenda of what we think is important. We get a lot of
input. [But] once it is decided, people don't get to vote with their feet.

We try to make a quantum leap here in terms of our ability to improve
pulling together all the pieces. Our customers want us to do
that. Simplifying concepts by unifying them. The customers don't say
they want us to do that, but when we do do that, they go, 'Ahhh, I get
it. That makes sense.'

I don't want to go to six more meetings where people say, 'Is your
workflow strategy BizTalk?' ... Or 'What's your Office workflow
strategy?' Or 'Why is synchronization in some ways better for e-mail and
Outlook than it is for file folders and Web pages?'

To get that sort of synchronization sometimes -- to get that high-level
road map to work -- you have to build something we don't have today. So
we have been talking about unifying storage. And so the best way to get
all this stuff to work is to get them all to work just one way. Then you
just keep tuning one set of parameters instead of having a thousand
flowers blooming.

> In your Fusion keynote today, you talked about who your competitors
> are, and it was the usual suspects. But one you didn't mention is
> yourself. You are competing against the last generation of your technology.

Always. Given that our stuff doesn't wear out or break down -- you can
question whether it breaks or not [Ballmer grins] -- but it doesn't
break down like machinery does. To get anyone to do something new, we
have to have something interesting and innovative.

People think, OK, should we just do more upgrades or try to sell more
new product? We decided that users like us to do a level of systems
integration so they don't have to get involved in that. So take
Sharepoint Team Services, which we put in Office. We could have sold
Team Services as a separate product, and we could have introduced a new
SKU [stock keeping unit]. We could have decided if it should work down
level with the old Office or just the new version of Office, and we
could do that with real-time communications. But we tend to like to put
things together, integrate them, and then release batches?1202?-- which
are then 'upgrades' -- as a form of introducing our new innovation. But
no matter how you do it, because our stuff does not wear out, we have to
convince people that some idea we have is better or more powerful than
the older idea we had.

And there are two aspects of doing that. One aspect is, on a given
product or upgrade release, does that make sense? Or do we convince you
that over an nyear period of time we will have enough innovation that
you will want to be licensed for that innovation. And this is part of
this whole licensing discussion we are having.

We moved to the new licensing for two reasons, I would say. No. 1, we
wanted to simplify our licensing. When we look back a year from now, I
guarantee you that where we are now is simpler than where we
were. Nothing is simpler during a transition because they are learning
the new and are more familiar with the old, but I think people will
eventually realize this is simpler. Our licensing got pretty complicated
over the years, and some people came to not understand it all.

The other issue is [the timing of delivering] our innovation. I don't
want to have a lot of rough questions [from customers]. So when we do
have new ideas, it's like, OK, should we put it in this upgrade or that
one or just have a stream of stuff that only our best customers have
access to under the terms of their contract? I think in the long run we
have a better chance of satisfying them with the latter than with
hitting them with six different upgrades. I am a fan of [letting] the
customer decide, OK, I want that piece or this piece. But they are
licensed for all of it. So those are the two things we sought to do.

The truth is, we need to be better at both. There are some things you
can only do big and lumpy, like a new file system. It's not like some
sort of small user feature; if you change the file system, then the
storage, the backup, probaby those things are going to change. Probably
the shell ought to change.The applications ... a lot of things are going
to change. Can you call that lumpy? Or you can put out four new features
in PowerPoint, sure -- that would not look lumpy to users.

I think we have to build trust in the model, and we are going to have to
deliver more over time. It will not come overnight. People will have to
see that we do a few things, ... that not all of our innovation is
lumpy, that more of it comes evenly and steadily. People develop a
confidence and faith; they like both aspects of the model. Over time,
our support needs to become more intimately involved in that story.

We know that, but we don't know exactly what that means yet. And this
whole notion of software as a service -- this is not a licensing or
business discussion. It's how does software get rearchitected in the
world of the Internet? I mean, how many software products are
fundamentally different because of the Internet? Not many. Probably the
anti-virus guys keep up the best. They are always feeding new virus
support in. I asked the audience [at Fusion] how many use Windows
Update. Now that's a small piece of software, but it is big. That's the
consumer market; we've got to get that to really purr in the corporate market.

The No. 1 thing is, we have to make software that is so compelling that
people will start saying, 'Well, of course I am going to get broadband.'

> And 802.11 is one of those compelling features?

Yes, it is. I was in a hotel in Sun Valley, [Utah], this week that was
not wired. So I turned on my PC, and XP tells me there is a wireless
network available. So I connect to something called Mountaineer. Well, I
don't know what that is. But I have a VPN into Microsoft; it worked. I
don't know whose broadband I used. I didn't see it in Bill's room. I
called him up and said, 'Hey, come over to my room.' So soon everyone is
there and connecting to the Internet through my room.

We have to support all the modalities, whether it is GPRS [General
Packet Radio Service] or 802.11. We have to make it easy to provision
from a software perspective for things that go on with DSL [and] cable
modems. ... And the software has to want a broadband link. There are not
many things you do where you say I really care about the performance. If
I am downloading PowerPoint files, then I want broadband. So when you
can do things with speed that you otherwise can't do without speed, that
is going to put a lot of pressure on the broadband community.

That's the weird answer. The more normal answer is, yeah, isn't it
awful: There is not enough broadband, and the prices they charge ... . I
agree with all that. If you look at what happened in Japan recently,
there was a big drop -- it is now $25 a month for DSL. Vroom. They have
gone from almost no DSL connections a year ago to 1.5 [million] or 1.8
million [subscribers].

> So how do we make that happen in this country?

I think that is beyond us. If there is enough interest where the
consumers are looking intensely for broadband, whether it is at today's
prices or tomorrow's prices, that is going to shake out the
marketplace. And I think the marketplace will do a good job. We just
have to make it something obvious that consumers want. Now I happen to
live in a neigborhood where there is no broadband network. No DSL or
cable modems. Well, I have a neighbor, [Teledesic chairman and co-CEO]
Craig McCaw, who has a wireless network that I think I can piggyback off
of [Ballmer laughs]. So, yes, broadband is a bottleneck -- but I also
think we have to look at oursleves as a software industry and say,
'Aren't we, too, some of that bottleneck?' We have not built software
that makes broadband a must-have.

aDaM@XeNT.CoM -- long .sig alert!



I believe it is quite possible to productively apply both supposedly
incompatible approaches [REST & SOAP] together.  I'll sketch it out
below, both in prescriptive form.  Note: while this is proscriptive, it
is expected that local adaptations will be provided.

1. Start by modeling the persistent resources that you wish to expose.
By persistent resources, I am referring to entities that have a typical
life expectancy of days or greater.  Ensure that each instance has a
unique URL.  When possible, assign meaningful names to resources.

2. Whenever possible, provide a default XML representation for each
representation.  Unlike traditional object oriented programming
languages where there is a unique getter per property, typically there
will be a single representation of the entire instance.  These
representations will often contain XLinks (a.k.a. pointers or
references) to other instances.

3. Now add high level methods which take care of all composite create,
update, and delete operations.  A key aspect of the design is that
messages for these operations need to be self contained - both the
sender and receiver should be able to make the absolute minimum of
assumptions as to the other's state, and multiple requests should not be
required to implement a single logical operation.  All requests should
provide the appearance of being executed atomically.

4. Query operations deserve special consideration.  A general purpose
XML syntax should be provided in every case.  In addition, when a
reasonable expectation exists that query parameters will be of a
relatively short size and not require significant encoding, then a HTTP
GET with the parameters encoded as a query string should also be
provided.

Implications  

The following table emphasizes how this unified approach differs from
the ""pure"" (albeit hypothetical) different positions described above.

1. Resource -- POST operations explicitly have the possibility of
modifying multiple resources.  PUT and DELETE operations are rarely
used, if ever.  GETs may contain query arguments.

2. Get -- GETs must never be used for operations which observably change
the state of the recipient.  POST should be used instead.

3. Message -- Do not presume that URLs are static, instead presume that
they identify the resource.  In particular, recognize that URLs can be
dynamically generated.  Expect URLs of other SOAP Resources in
responses.  Use the SOAP Response MEP for pure retrieval operations.

4. Procedure -- Treat the URL itself as the implicit first parameter.
Allow URLs to be dynamically generated, and returned in structures.  Use
HTTP GET for retrieval operations.

Conclusions  

Looking to the future, the application level inter-networking protocols
that emerge today will likely be the application level intra-networking
protocols of the next decade.  Both REST and SOAP contain features that
the others lack.  Most significantly:

REST - SOAP = XLink

The key bit of functionality that SOAP applications miss today is the
ability to link together resources.  SOAP 1.2 makes significant progress
in addressing this.  Hopefully WSDL 1.2 will complete this important work.

SOAP - REST = Stored Procedures

Looking at how other large scale systems cope with updates provides some
key insights into productive areas for future research with respect to REST.

Finally, it bears repeating.  Just because a service is using HTTP GET,
doesn't mean that it is REST.  If you are encoding parameters on the
URL, you are probably making an RPC request of a service, not retrieving
the representation of a resource.  It is worth reading Roy Fielding's
 thoughts
on the subject.  The only exception to this rule that is routinely
condoned within the REST crowd is queries.

But Colossus was not for Enigma. The bombes used for Enigma were
electro-mechanical. I'm not aware of any application of optical techniques
to Enigma, unless they were done in the US and are still classified. And
clearly, the first bulk breaks of Enigma were done by the bombes, so I
guess it depends whether you count bombes as computers or not, whether this
statement has any credibility at all.

I've got a small problem but still annoying. I upgraded from RH 7.1 to 
RH 7.3 and everything looks ok except that the time is ahead by one 
hour. I've been looking the man files for hwclock and options but it 
simply doesn't work, it gives the following error from he shell as well 
as from the startup while loading the kernel:  hwclock: ioctl() to 
/dev/rtc to turn on update interrupts failed unexpectedly, errno=25: 
Inappropriate ioctl for device.
.... my solution at the time is to enter the setup of the PC and reduce 
the time by one hour (awful!)

475,"Security update for Debian Testing - 2010-04-23This automatic mail gives an overview over security issues that were recently 
fixed in Debian Testing. The majority of fixed packages migrate to testing 
from unstable. If this would take too long, fixed packages are uploaded to the 
testing-security repository instead. It can also happen that vulnerable 
packages are removed from Debian testing.

Migrated from unstable:
=======================
couchdb 0.11.0-1:
CVE-2010-0009: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0009

You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time mailing, so no removal is necessary. 

If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. 

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. 
The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 
The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 

HERE'S GOOD NEWS 

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. 

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period.

Cordially,

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And it's FREE!

Perhaps. You could certainly build a kernel that doesn't require the

No, rather a new breakthrough in ballistic snake oil delivery. So it's
built into a walkthrough gate, and is noninvasive. It's supposed to
analyse brain and heart activity. While you can pick up heartbeat by
Doppler radar, later tells it's realtime DSP on an array of SQIDs. Later
they mention they use passive IR imaging and eye saccade evaluation. Maybe
they're also doing a Kirlian reading, and recording your mana flux, too.
(Conclusive evaluation by entrail reading is nonoptional only for
confirmed terrorists).

So they claim terrorist intent translates in biosignatures they can pick
up by close-distance passive telemetry, in realtime, with a very low
number of false positives, while having no chance to calibrate, in the
field.

Right.

Seems somebody is so awfully eager to pick up a slice of research grant
pie from the heimatland securitate money they haven't even bothered to 
invent a plausible lie.

I do not have this.
I am (still) using the guarddog (kde3) firewall which sets the iptables rules. 
There is no ""active"" rules set otherwise.

I could make it, but I think that the guarddog would override. I could add 
this after the fact, however. I will try it.

The unexpected forced downgrade from KDE 3.5 to 4 in Sid actually
ended up being a good thing for me. (the loss of the ability to have a
different background for each desktop was a KDE showstopper.  So the
forced downgrade prompted me to actually take a serious look at other
desktop environments.   And had that not happened, I would not be
using Enlightenment on all my Linux boxes today.  I have become quite
enamored with Enlightenment, and now see no need whatsoever to go back
to KDE or switch to Gnome.

Granted, I will happily use various KDE and Gnome based tools if
needed.  That is no big deal.  But E (with the Steampunk theme)  is
now my environment of choice.  :)  Only drawback so far I have
encountered is the inability to change the background color on the
desktop if the wallpaper image does not fill the entire screen.  It
can be a bit hard on the eyes with that harsh white background, but I
think I can get used to it.

I worked on a testharness for (wait for it) petrol pumps some years ago,
little embeded controller spoke to its DOS (not exactly the easiest
environment to track crashing bugs under) master which logged its
piteous whinings. I inherited the dos part of it and worked mostly on
creating the other end of it. Near the end of the project we gave it
extensive long burnin tests, sadly overnight tests would always crash
out for some obscure reason.  Tracking it down showed that my
predecessor's ""add new entries to the end of its linked list"" function
recursively called itself with each following link until the terminating
one showed up. Of course it died miserably when it ran out of stack. I'm
sure he felt he'd done a good days work when he planted that bomb for
me.

1155,"EBusiness Webforms: cluetrain has left the stationWhat's wrong with doing business over the Web?  Web forms.  There's
promising replacements forms, but this is the current state of the
industry:

 o You find something that you want to fill out.  It's a partnership form,
   a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything.
 o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend
   about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops
   just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback
   when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your
   time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. 
 o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized.
   I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world
   listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you
   to hit submit, but due to the layout, the ""more>"" tag on the second
   row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except
   about two dozen third world countries. 
 o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain
   about using the universal country phone number format and will cause
   you to re-enter dashes instead of dots.
 o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and
   enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will
   automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to
   go back and resent that freaking thing too.  Finally after all combinations
   of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit.
 o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation.  
 o Sometimes, like today, you won't be able to ever submit anything due
   to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that
   is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their
   forms submission.

What's wrong with this picture?  The company is screwing you by wasting
your time enforcing their data collection standards on you.  I'm sure there's
someone in that company that would be willing to accept ""US"", ""U.S"", ""USA""
""United States"", ""U of A"", ""America"", etc. and would know exactly which
freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them
to waste even more time playing Web form geography.  

I'm starting to see the light of Passport.  You want more information?  Hit
this passport button.  Voila.  IE6 and Netscape 6,7 have pre-forms sutff,
but I always turn it off because you never know when there's that one field
that you don't want to submit to the person you are submitting to that 
automatically gets sent, i.e. the privacy stuff is well beyond the 
average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff.  

So, if crappy forms-based submission is the state of practice for
business enablement on the Web, I can't see this whole data submission
and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as
working all that well.

Attention: Dear Friend 

I am Michael Bantu the chief accountant of ABSA Bank Benoni branch South Africa I am making this contact with you based on the need for an individual / company who is willing to assist me with a solution to a money transfer. 


There is an account which I have been the account officer since 1999 and till 2003  and nobody has operated on this account again after going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Mohammed El Zaki, a foreigner, and acontractor to THE BEERS DIAMOND COMPANY, who died since 2000.No other person knows this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the money because I have been updating report to the bank since the death of the owner (Mr. Mohammed El Zaki) the money involved is 15 Million fifteen million   United States Dollars (US$ 15,500,000 Million).I want this money into your safe overseas account as soon as possible. 

I am seeking your assistance as a foreigner, since as civil servant I am not allowed to operate foreign accounts with such amount. Should you be willing to assist in this

transaction your share as compensation will be (30%) while my colleagues and I receive (65%) and the balance (5%) for any expenses that may be incurred by either party. 

The business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does not matter also your area of specialization, is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. We have reposed confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.


Note that the transaction will only take 10 working days if trust and work with one mind, all documents regards to the success of this transaction are with me.

 

I am ready to go into business partnership with you as soon as the money is transferred into your account.

Upon your acceptance of this transaction, send me your private phone and fax number for easier communication


Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.

109,"Feedback from my posting about FogBUGZ Setup fell into four
    categories. *URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021008.html
Date: Not supplied

Feedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. 

*""Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information 
from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a 
couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in 
one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle 
of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will 
back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error 
messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can 
fail is not insignificant. 

Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 
after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we 
prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: 

[IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup 
Screenshot)] 

The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be 
predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might 
not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of 
Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha 
didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away 
so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 
long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if 
you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 
of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left 
their system in an indeterminate state. 

In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account 
in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of 
the wizard where I can display a useful error message. 

And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to 
upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a 
reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 
keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So 
part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it 
would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I 
don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the 
code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to 
call it at the right place. 

I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then 
do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very 
slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even 
FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" 
operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of 
the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for 
IIS to stop and start. 

*""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 
has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave 
your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed 
to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious 
arguments are unbelievably boring.  

Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, 
since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And 
I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really 
well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would 
definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), 
certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do 
in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to 
an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 
is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you 
search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you 
find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I 
know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated 
Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that 
costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 
productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the 
code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library 
I've been using for years to make wizards. 

*""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup 
programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and 
made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: 

- Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the 
life of the code. 
- Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want 
them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate 
because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of 
SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the 
new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another 
morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all 
the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and 
Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it 
suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's 
too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 
lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. 
- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 
standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and 
oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a 
meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, 
mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing 
software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is 
guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 
and say ""Aha!""


*""How can we make WISE[4] better?"" *Kudos to the product manager of WISE 
Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the 
reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical IIS/ASP/SQL applications.

1286,"The GOv gets tough on Net Users.....er Pirates..from http://www.arstechnica.com/

""There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department
of Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against
individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted
material over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes
that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to
preserve the viability of America's content industries."" Malcolm also
believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are
participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download
copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions
such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see
businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of
copyrighted works.


""Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think
they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal
prosecution,"" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same
conference panel.

I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is
hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or
warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor
deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits
carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate
further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to
initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems
participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from
the crowd.

The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines
illegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:


Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for
purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the
reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any
180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more
copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....
For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution
of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish
willful infringement.
...
The term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of
anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.


Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain""
even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the
value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15
to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the
perspective of the consumer or copyright holder.

The statute of limitations:


507. Limitations on actions

(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained
under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five
years after the cause of action arose.

(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the
provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after
the claim accrued.

The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in
Section 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time
criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.

I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to
prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess
would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent
individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be
targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. Thanks to
MonaLisaOverdrive for pointing out this story.

Reader Jack Macdonald has some advice for you would-be bards in the audience: 

""You mention Karaoke being featured at Gnomedex and you 
might want to point out to other Gnomies that they could 
practice their Karaoke on my Red Hot 
Karaoke Page site. There are the words and music for 
more than 1100 songs available on the site and by 
downloading the Yamanha Midiplug (a link is provided) they 
can even change the key of the song to suit their voice 
range as well as speed up or slow down the music to their 
taste. In other words, to have the same experience as they 
would have with professional Karaoke equipment but at no 
extra cost! At this price (zero) a lot of gnomies going to 
Gnomedex could be singing up a storm by being properly 
prepared for your Karaoke.""

Travel day on Wednesday as I head down to Ankeny, Iowa to 
help out a former co-worker and avid Gnomie with some server 
and networking stuff. The tough part is remembering 
everything I'll need. It never fails, though. I always, 
always, always forget something. I can make lists two weeks 
in advance and I'll end up 30 miles down the road with a 
handprint on my forehead when I come to the realization that 
I left something important behind. What will it be this 
time, I wonder? I'll let you know on Thursday.

Forwarding to Internet Address Fails

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q181636

Client inquires about the possibility of forwarding all 
internal and Internet email to his AOL mailbox when he's out 
of the office, and I figure it's going to be a piece of 
cake. He recently acquired a new phone through Verizon along 
with web access and a tie into his AOL mailbox, which was 
the driving force behind this request. What I found was that 
Internet email proved to be easy using a simple forwarding 
rule, but none of the internal Exchange email was being sent 
out to the Internet upon receipt, even though it appeared to 
be included in the rule. As it happens, this is due to a 
default configuration option on the Exchange 5.5 server that 
prevents automatic replies/forwards from being sent to the 
Internet using the Exchange Internet Mail Service. A quick 
configuration change and restart of IMS will put things 
right.

Stop the Presses

http://www.wininformant.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=25802

... The CD presses, that is. Microsoft has given in to 
the greater good and delayed Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 
indefinitely. Sure, it's mildly disappointing, but I applaud 
the move. Instead of trying to downplay the previously 
identified problems with Microsoft Installer (MSI) 2.0, the 
service pack will be put on ice until the issues are 
straightened out. Here's a quote for you... Good job, 
Microsoft.

Windows XP System File Checker

Dean Truax mentioned the System File Checker as a 
possible solution to my Windows Media Player problem under 
Windows XP, and I did indeed run through it prior to 
attempting an in-place upgrade, obviously with no 
improvement. It's still worth a mention, however, in case 
you're not familiar with what it's there for. As you're 
probably aware, XP contains a file protection scheme that 
will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or 
altered in any way, ensuring that XP is kept in a stable 
state. Sometimes this system can get a little out of whack, 
and the SFC is meant to restore order. Note that any 
hotfixes and other Microsoft-provided updates will be left 
in place since they properly update the DLL Cache that is 
used as the sanity check to determine if a system file has 
been messed with. To access the SFC, simply launch a command 
prompt and type ""SFC"" to display a list of options.

Consider This
Forwarded by JW

http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,72519,00.html

The next time you have a face-to-face with your elected 
representatives, you might want to start asking about their 
opinions on technology laws that are being proposed left and 
right. Holding a public office seems to be introducing brain 
death more frequently considering proposals by Senator Fritz 
Hollings and now LA congressman Howard Berman. If Mr. Berman 
gets his way, companies may very well be allowed to hack 
into your systems without proof of provocation in order to 
ensure that you are using their software according to the 
stated rules. Mind you, if they cause colateral damage or 
upset other systems, there isn't thing one you can do in 
return. Nope, they'll have legal protection. This garbage is 
seriously getting scary. If you think it won't be abused, 
consider the case of Dimitry Skylarov when he publicly 
pointed out eBook security problems with Adobe's software 
and was promptly thrown in jail for his trouble under the 
authority of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. He was 
eventually released, but that doesn't make it any more 
right.

Date: 2002-09-23T09:27:30-05:00

No, really. My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over 
the weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing 
other things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum. I have the 
10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not 
convinced myself that &#8220;it's not that bad&#8221; and trudged through it 
all without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll 
be back this afternoon. 

My email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me 
at my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. 

Kevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS 
feed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of 
being able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these 
variations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that 
mean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different 
vocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so 
great for consumers who have to make sense of it all. 

For each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) 
needs to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ 
documentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented 
documentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers 
questions written in English. &#8220;How do I include personal information in 
my RSS feed?&#8221; is a goal-oriented question. &#8220;Create a FOAF file 
using this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS 
feed&#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. 
Anything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a 
dictionary.

1645,"Security update for Debian Testing - 2010-04-28This automatic mail gives an overview over security issues that were recently 
fixed in Debian Testing. The majority of fixed packages migrate to testing 
from unstable. If this would take too long, fixed packages are uploaded to the 
testing-security repository instead. It can also happen that vulnerable 
packages are removed from Debian testing.

Migrated from unstable:
=======================
cacti 0.8.7e-3:
CVE-2010-1431: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1431
               http://bugs.debian.org/578909



How to update:
--------------
Make sure the line

	deb http://security.debian.org squeeze/updates main contrib non-free

is present in your /etc/apt/sources.list. Of course, you also need the line
pointing to your normal squeeze mirror. You can use

	aptitude update && aptitude dist-upgrade

to install the updates.


More information:

_Jeffrey Zeldman_: OS X Blues update[1]. 

    A couple of intellectuals have pointed out parallels between the rigidity 
    of OS X, which derives its power from Unix and XML, and the rules of 
    standards-based web development, which also compels you to do things the 
    right way instead of using five different non-standard hacks. The parallel 
    is not without merit. Building web pages the right way is hard at first, 
    but once you get it, you never want to go back. Regardless, we miss OS 9's 
    flexibility and ease of use, and a metric ton of logic doesn't offset that 
    feeling of loss.

Too bad. I don't normally like list moderation but I would sure make an

BTW he emailed me direct telling me to f***k myself and calling me a

Assuming you talk about this character: ², which is Unicode U+00b2, or 
SUPERSCRIPT TWO, just map your keyboard to do that for you. For example 
for assigning the combination AltGr-2 (AltGr is the right-Alt, if not 
marked as such):

xmodmap -e ""keycode 0x0B =  2 at 0x010000b2""

To automate this add that line in your .xsession or .xinitrc.
For many changes to the keyboard make your own .xmodmap file
and add xmodmap .xmodmap in your .xsession or .xinitrc file.

Best regards,
	Ionel

MARKET CAN'T FIND ITS BOTTOM WITH BOTH HANDS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Remember when Nasdaq 2500 seemed impossibly low? Welcome back to 
cruel reality. These days, with few analysts willing to call a
market bottom, financial reporters outdo each other with dire
assessments of how bad things are and how much worse they can
get. Maybe Morrissey should do a concert on Wall Street; the
self-pity can't get much worse.

The markets' closing numbers were the same in every city, but
you wouldn't know it from the headlines. It was the Dow's worst
monthly performance in four years, said MSNBC. ""3rd quarter
worst for stocks since '87,"" read the Denver Post, repeating a
popular figure reached by tallying the Dow and S&P's percentage
losses. The New York Daily News counted percentage losses for
the month only and declared it the worst September since 1937.
Everyone predicted a lousy September 2002, so the phrase
""self-fulfilling prophecy"" does spring to mind. 

So does the phrase ""gloom and doom."" ""Every day for the last
three months, the market has erased $73 of wealth, including
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, for every person living in the
United States,"" said the San Jose Mercury News. ""Countless
investors are starting to wonder if stocks will ever go up
again,"" wrote USA Today. In a more plausible statement,
TheStreet.com's Aaron Task said recent declines ""demonstrated
once again the folly of investors' repeated attempts to pinpoint 
a bottom"" and ""disabuse(d) them of the idea that the best time
to buy is when things look worst, if only because recent history 
has shown stocks can go from terrible to awful and beyond."" 

OK, breathe. Go read the comics or something. Feeling better?
Good, because there's more.

The New York Post, in small enough words for everyone to
understand, made the public service announcement ""Beware!
October Is A Very Bad Month For The Stock Market."" And you
shouldn't take candy from strangers, either. The Post's John
Crudele, a market curmudgeon before it was in style, warned,
""This market is very dangerous, even if things look like they
couldn't get any worse."" Detroit Free Press columnist Susan
Tompor agreed that ""the next round of statements could indeed
look pretty nasty."" 

We have to agree: the stock market is bad. The economy is bad.
It's going to get worse before it gets better, and that may take 
a while. The ""bottom"" is, technically, zero. Be cautious, yes,
but don't let the media's bipolar disorder ruin your day. Just
like dot-coms weren't really a new economy, a bear market isn't
the end of the world. - Jen Muehlbauer

WINNICK: HANDS-OFF OR RED-HANDED?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Former Global Crossing chairman Gary Winnick will appear before
a Congressional committee today. It won't be pretty. CNN
predicted he will plead the Fifth. Most other outlets expected
Winnick to testify.

Impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the
House Energy and Commerce Committee of memos indicating that
Winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. A
committee spokesman said, ""If he tries to portray himself as an
out-of-the-loop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him
that he is under oath.""

The memo that got most of the attention was one from then-CEO
Leo Hindery to Winnick in June 2001. Hindery warned in colorful
language that the company was heading for a fall. The Financial
Times, Washington Post, and New York Times all ran a quote from
the memo comparing telcos to salmon. Hindery urged Winnick to
unload the company -- ""without looking like we are shaking our
bootie all over the world,"" quoted the two Timeses -- and
resigned shortly thereafter.

One little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make Winnick's 
time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. Among
the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals,
was Enron. All the reports mentioned Enron, but the New York
Times seemed to be alone in noting that Global Crossing never
completed a deal with the fallen energy giant.

The Wall Street Journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing 
details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence,
the gun might not be smoking yet. ""Prosecutors would still need
to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used
them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the
company's stock price artificially,"" the Journal reporters
wrote. The AP noted that all of the memos were dated after
Winnick's last sale of Global Crossing stock, $123 million in
May 2001.

Despite his $734 million in stock profits, Gary Winnick was not
among the five telco executives being sued by New York attorney
general Eliot Spitzer to return their ill-gotten gains. Is
Spitzer betting, with the Journal, that Winnick might walk away
clean? - Keith Dawson

1643,"Re: Optical analog computing?Uh, WWII Enigma was cracked at Bletchly Park, based on the work of some 
Poles, who had been trying to figure out when they would be invaded.   
Entirely mechanical!   Definitely not optical at all.    Enigma was 
originally broken based on bad use practice.  If it had been employed more 
sensibly it would have been a lot harder.

See ""The Code Book"" by Singh, Doubleday, 1999.     Or, for that matter, 
""Cryptonomicon"" by Stephenson, which is a fictionalization of the Enigma 
cracking story, and pretty accurate.

I eventually get born as a side-effect of the Battle of Britain, you 
see....

Computing with interference patterns, etc, makes perfect sense, but Enigma 
was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially Enigma 
machines and brute-forcing.

The program has different behaviour depending on the value of
argv[0], probably...

here's a simple example...

#include 
#include 
#include 

long int add(long int a, long int b)
{
  return a+b;
}

long int subtract(long int a, long int b)
{
  return a-b;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  long int a, b; /* Operands */
  long int (*operation)(long int a, long int b);
  char *progname, *marker;

  if(argc != 3)
  {
    fprintf(stderr, ""Usage: %s [int1] [int2]\n"", argv[0]);
    exit(1);
  }

  progname = strrchr(argv[0], '/');
  if(progname == NULL)
    progname = argv[0];
  else
    progname ++; /* Skip past the '/' */
  
  if(strcmp(progname, ""add"") == 0)
  {
    operation = add;
  }
  else if (strcmp(progname, subtract) == 0)
  {
    operation = subtract;
  }
  else
  {
    fprintf(stderr, ""Program called with invalid ""
            ""name %s. Quitting.\n"", argv[0]);
    exit(1);
  }

  a = strtol(argv[1], &marker, 0); /* Use base 16 for args
                                    * starting 0x, and base 8 for 
                                    * args starting 0 */
  if(*marker != '\0')
  {
    fprintf(stderr, ""Invalid character %c in argument %s.\n"",
            *marker, argv[1]);
    exit(1);
  }

  b = strtol(argv[2], &marker, 0); /* Use base 16 for args
                                    * starting 0x, and base 8 for 
                                    * args starting 0 */
  if(*marker != '\0')
  {
    fprintf(stderr, ""Invalid character %c in argument %s.\n"",
            *marker, argv[2]);
    exit(1);
  }
  
  printf(""%ld %c %ld = %ld\n"", 
          a, 
          (operation == add)?'+':'-', 
          b, 
          operation(a, b));
          
  return 0;
}

Say that's in operation.c, compile it using 

gcc -ansi -pedantic -Wall -W -O2 -o add operation.c
and then 
ln add subtract
and run both, with appropriate arguments.

Dear Investor,

Thank you again for requesting our free special 
report, ""The One Stock that Keeps Wall Street 
BUZZING.""

We began The Motley Fool in 1993 with the idea that 
investors like you deserved better. 

Better than Wall Street's all-too-often biased 
research...  Better than analysts who speak in ""secret 
codes"" allowing them to hedge or spin any 
recommendation...  and better than what passes for ""full 
financial disclosure"" in big business today.

Given a level playing field, we believe that regular 
folks -- like us, and you -- can do quite well in the 
stock market. Why put trust in conflicted information 
from others when you could count on your own 
abilities, and potentially blow the pros away? 

More than two million people visit our Fool.com web 
site each month.  We spend a great deal of time at 
Fool.com instructing people HOW to invest, but not so 
much about WHERE to invest.

Advisor.

Gardner.  We'll tell you exactly why we believe a

all the facts to back that analysis up.  You'll get 
the good, the bad and the ugly on every recommendation 
we make -- so you can make each investing decision 
with great confidence.

Of course, there's more to our Motley Fool Stock 
Advisor than our monthly newsletter.

You'll also receive our monthly, between-issue, e-mail 
Fool Flash to help you take full advantage of breaking 
opportunities.  And you can log on anytime at the 
Motley Fool Stock Advisor subscriber-only Web site,

I was, I thought, supporting your view that most/many people simply don't 
_want_ to know.  Why does their reluctance have to be ""valid""?

Are you saying that only those who want to learn to administer it should be 
allowed to use Linux?

284,"OT - Backup of HA server on external driveFrom nobody Thu Sep  6 17:44:54 2018
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hi all,

I have to make a backup plan for a server that is physically very far away
from me right now. If for some reason this server goes south, I have to have
a plan and it has to be done quickly. The problem is that the personnel that
is on site doesn't know squat about Linux (or computers, for that matter),
so it must be something dead simple. I was thinking of getting a spare hard
drive, connect it to the working server, do a dd of the entire disk to the
new disk, and disconnect the disk (the people there can swap hard disks).
Something like

dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdb bs=1024

assuming that sda is the working disk and sdb is the new, unformatted and
unpartitioned disk. So if hte machine breaks, I can get the new disk and put
in a new machine and everything should work. This server is doing firewall
and openvpn, etc, no X, no fancy stuff. Is this going to work? What do you
guys think?

Cheers!

Ok. It looks like you haven't run the latest make-kpkg.

I just did a rebuild of an existing built source tree. The make-kpkg
output contained 8839 lines of output just to describe unlinking things
in the debian/... directory. That 8839 lines is about 980kB. There was
later objcopy output from the make-kpkg process amounting to 180kB. The
rest of the output is 73kB. It's a significant difference.

488,"Audible bell in MetacityHello List,

I like my audible bell very much. I really really like it =E2=80=93
unfortunately, Metacity (from current Testing) blocks it in the
following way:

* ""beep"" works fine
* ""xkbbell -force"" works, but it doesn't w/o the ""-force""
* Gnome-Terminal and all the other applications can only bell
  ""visible"", i. e. I get a flash when enabling the visible bell in
  Metacity's gconf-preferences but no audible bell if I disable it
  (and leave ""audible bell"" enabled).
* The module pcspkr is compiled into the kernel and works fine, as
  proven above.
* The volume of the ""Bell""-output is at 50% in Alsamixer, and as
  proven above, ok this way.

I assume this is the same bug as described in
https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/metacity/+bug/486154/

and comment 50 seems to provide a solution I didn't test yet =E2=80=93 my
question is, wether or not there is a Debian-way to enable the bell
in Metacity or if I have to switch window managers as Piotr Engelking
did here: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=3D551590

The hints he gave in this bug report unfortunately don't work for me
=E2=80=93 I enabled the corresponding keys, but still can't hear a bell,
probably because I don't use ESD (is there any reason why I should
install this? ALSA works just fine for me=E2=80=A6)

223,"Dragon Player bad AVI audioI'm running Debian Testing on two computers, and Dragon Player has 
terrible audio when I play AVI files, but only on *one* of the 
computers.  It has a lot of noise / hiss over top of the regular audio.

Both computers have the same packages installed, thus it must be a 
hardware difference.  The computer with normal audio is a laptop running 
the built-in speakers.  The computer with the bad audio is a tower 
playing the audio through USB speakers (built into my monitor).

Interestingly, mplayer gives ok audio on both computers, and codeine 
(which I understand is the KDE3 version of Dragon Player) also gives ok 
audio on both computers.

All other audio applications work fine on both computers (youtube, 
Skype, system notifications).

Has anyone else encountered this problem?

I'm changing the instructions in the SpamAssassin INSTALL file 
right now to:

tar xfvz dcc-dccproc.tar.Z
cd dcc-dccproc-X.X.X
./configure && make && make install
cdcc 'info'


Let me know ASAP if that's innapropriate, since we're shipping 
2.40 today!

FWIW, if you'd like to rely on such a scheme for security by obstacles,
you'd have to use something else than pdf. pdf's scheme is broken.
That's all.

The reason that it is broken for pdfs is that the specifications for pdf
are freely available, and thus alternative pdf readers have been
developed. Your scheme would require closed specifications and closed
software to work. This list, however, is all about free software.

1170,"We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ 3.0 should support custom
    fields. HistorURL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020912.html
Date: Not supplied

We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. 
Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get 
abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything 
they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. 
End result: people don't enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not 
capturing all that information. You can always ""page fault"" to get the 
information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in 
every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine 
(this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be 
relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the 
programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be 
dll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking 
for the DLL info? Similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you 
ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but 
trust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing 
only: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first 
place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can 
always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be 
relevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on 
Windows 98SE? Aha! You can't. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not 
every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so 
this search doesn't make sense in the first place. The info wasn't captured. Do 
a full text search for 98SE and you'll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) 

Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of 
information -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on 
the computer in question and while you're at it, a photograph of the tester's 
workspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_, 
which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I 
have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking 
package was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the 
system, because they didn't know what all those fields were. The _real_ 
bug-""tracking"" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. 

A pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, ""does 
FogBUGZ support custom fields?"" Rather than giving our usual answer (""no. on 
purpose."") over the last few weeks I've been saying, ""can you please tell me 
what fields you would need? We're trying to decide whether to implement that 
feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it."" The interesting thing 
is, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the 
other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn't be fields. And in fact, our 
existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our 
biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted 
to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, 
but I didn't, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track 
of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are 
happy and keep buying more site licenses. 

But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking 
software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in 
our product. ""Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields."" Righto. It's true. And 
who am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to 
yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a 
built-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and 
inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But 
it's still rude of me to tell customers that we don't have that feature _for 
their own good_, even though it usually is, and we're losing some sales because 
of it. 

Sigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so 
hard to use that people don't use it. At least we won't lose any sales :)

Always nice to have one to put stuff that overrides RH things. Like if
you absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources
with different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump
release numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert
into apt and let loose... :)

Doesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as
up2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another
repository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC. Not sure if that had The
updates.

I've tried various ideas found with Google.
Remove the intel driver and leave the vesa 
driver installed for example.

Is fb a standalone driver?  Is it an accessory 
to the vesa driver?

Thanks for any ideas,          ... Peter E.

Agreed, but it's not one that is likely to be fixed. There seems to be
no backwards-compatibility in KDE anymore. It's a problem, I know.

1212,"JPEGs patented------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A video conferencing company based in Austin, Texas says it's going to
pursue royalties on the transmission of JPEG images.

And it's already found a licensee: Sony Corporation.

Formerly known as VTEL, Forgent Networks acquired Compression Labs in
1997, acquiring this patent into the bargain.  The patent claim was
filed in 1986 but Compression Labs never pursued royalties.

I'm not familiar with your laptop, but most laptops have a way to switch
back and forth between the internal display and an external display via
the internal keyboard.  On the IBM ThinkPad machines that I use (a 600
and a 390E) it is Fn+F7.  Consult your hardware documentation.

Switching between the two is much easier if your external monitor
is an LCD monitor.  The internal display probably runs at 60 Hz vertical
refresh.  The external monitor, if it is an LCD display, will probably
want to run at 60 Hz vertical refresh also.  An external CRT monitor,
however, will probably have noticeable flicker at 60 Hz vertical refresh.
It will want to use a higher vertical refresh rate: at least 72 Hz.

Switching back and forth dynamically between internal and external monitors
is tricky if they want to use different resolutions and refresh rates.
It often won't work.

Unfortunately not, it's a one at a time thing.  If it would help
you, I have a script that I use which handles a mbox file at a time,
strips the SA stuff, reports to razor, and can then do things like

1823,"On The Way to Telluride, On My Way Back to the WorldOn The Way to Telluride, On My Way Back to the World

8/29/02

Dear friends,

I go to turn my computer on but I have forgotten where the on/off switch
is. I have had this laptop for three years, but I haven't turned it on for
the past two months. I look on its left side, I feel around the back, I
find it on the right and I feel like an idiot. The screen reads ""fatal
error"" and offers to ""save"" whatever I had typed on it last June 21st, a
few weeks before my mother died. I hit CTL.ALT.DEL. and it is gone. Gone.
Gone like this long, sad, summer, frozen now, and nothing seemingly matters
but everything matters more now than ever before. Why did she have to die?
When will this pain stop? 

I got up this morning to fly out to Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival
is screening my film tomorrow night, the first time it will be shown in the
United States. My mother did not get to see this new film. She was always
so proud of everything I did, cheering me on every day from the day where
my memory begins. I had shown an early cut of the film to my friends last
winter in my parent's living room, and mom would come in and out of the
room, catching a scene here and there, saying, ""Boy, that's something,
isn't it!"" 

I don't feel right, right now. I have avoided most people for the past two
months. I can't conceive in my mind having to face a crowd of strangers, no
matter how supportive or appreciative they may be. Everyone says to me it
will be good to get back to work, good to be busy, take my mind off my
sadness, as if not aware that what I really might need is for it to be the
other way around. At my family's insistence, I tried going on TV a few
weeks ago to talk about the corporate crooks roaming our great land. I had
decided to give it a try, and gave it my best shot, and ended up feeling so
empty and more alone. I had agreed to go on ""Crossfire"" and Donahue (thank
God for this guy!) on the condition that I would not have to have one of
those stupid cable news shouting matches with three rightwingnuts where no
one can hear (or wants to hear) what's being said. 

They agreed to the terms, but as Bob Novak asked his first question about
aren't my true motives to destroy capitalism and make America a socialist
country, I just sat there for a moment and didn't respond. I thought I
would just take the microphone off and leave - who needs these f-----s! -
but then, my dad was with me in the studio and I looked over at him and
smiled, and then into the camera I said, yes, Bob, that is exactly what I
intend to do and, considering more people have bought my book than any
other nonfiction book in America this year, I guess that means that the
majority of Americans agree with me on this point, so look out Bob 'cause
we're going to seize your money first! I asked the studio audience in DC
for a show of hands of all those who agreed and I was later told that
numerous hands shot up in the air, much to the chagrin of a stunned Bob
Novak. I also added that I thought the Pope was onto something when he said
that capitalism is a ""sin.""

My dad liked that. He is a sweet, strong, smart man and I loved the drive
with him back home. We took a spin through the Michigan State campus and he
told me how he had come down here after World War II to inquire about going
to college but thought it best to return to the assembly line where he had
a secure job. His years during the war serving in the Marines were going to
be counted toward his seniority. And so he worked the spark plug and oil
filter assembly line for 33 years and provided for mom and us kids and gave
us all his love -- which, of course, mattered the most. 

                      *        *       *       *       *        *

Dad took me to the airport this morning, remarking on the way how much mom
would have enjoyed this simple trip across town to Bishop Airport, how
happy she would have been knowing that I was heading off on a new journey
in my very fortunate life. I thought about how she came to New York for the
screening of ""Roger & Me"" at the New York Film Festival in 1989, and how I
got to introduce her and my aunt as they sat in the front of the balcony,
and how mom and Aunt Lois stood and took a long Lincoln Center bow, and how
I stood on that stage and felt that she deserved every bit of that applause
and more. 

It's a bittersweet memory now, as I've just found out that the NYFF
selection committee this year is too afraid to show my new film.
""Politics,"" is what I have been told. Too ""populist"" for the new elite who
now sit in judgment of what is art. ""They don't want to help further your
platform Mike,"" a person close to the committee tells me. ""One of them even
said, 'I know this film is going to be popular - and I don't personally
want to contribute to its popularity.'""  So, it was decided that ""Bowling
for Columbine,"" a Cannes prize-winner, knighted by the Chicago Tribune as
""one of the most effective political/polemical films ever,"" a film chosen
by every single film festival around the world this fall - no, this film
must not be shown at Lincoln Center just six blocks from the edit room
where we made it... 77 blocks north of ground zero. I've gone too far this
time, cut too close to the bone, stuck my lens where it doesn't belong -
right straight through the heart of an America that is both master and
victim of the ultra-violence. It is so sad to see this place where I will
always remember my mother taking that bow now cowering to the whims of neos
who, like their counterparts in Hollywood, preside over the demolition of a
once great art form.

                     *      *      *      *      *      *      *

My dad drops me off and goes to park in the short-term lot. He comes inside
just as the airport personnel are taking everything out of my suitcase for
inspection. They don't ask to see the print of the film, the only thing I
might have had on me that is poised to do any real damage (to all the right
people, of course). My dad and I stop short of the metal detectors and the
next round of inspectors who are anxious to look at my smelly feet. We hug,
and he kisses me, and I am trying hard, so very hard, to not break down in
the middle of this airport. He tells me not to worry about him, and I tell
him I'll call him from Detroit when I am changing planes. I go through
security and as I am being taken aside to be searched again, I look back
and see him still standing there, watching out for me. My dad.

I'm on the plane and I'm thirsty, but I took the water bottle out of my bag
when I packed it this morning. The bottle, half-drank, had been sitting
untouched in my untouched bag since I stuck it in there the night we had to
rush my mom to the hospital. The bottle was still there in that overnight
bag where I put my t-shirt and sweatpants, the ones I had on for the night
and day I sat by my mother's side in the hospital as she struggled to live,
holding her hand, holding her head, trying to comfort her, strands of hair
on my sweater. I can see the stains from where my tears and mucus ran
uncontrollably down my face and onto that sweater. The doctor said she had
an 80% chance of making it. An hour before she died, another doctor said
the chances were 1 in 100. That was good enough for me. One in one hundred!
I've had those odds! I won! Don't let her die! Please do everything you can
do! Don't let her die.

The priest came, then another priest came, and when the priests left my dad
asked us three kids and the three grandkids to all join hands and say our
goodbyes to mom, say whatever we wanted to about what she meant to us. (I
am sorry... I cannot complete this paragraph right now, I can't see the
screen through the tears...maybe someday...)

The night before we rushed her to the hospital I had a little surprise
planned for her. I had brought a copy of my new movie and I was going to
show it to her. As the end credits would roll, she would get to see what
she has seen at the end of all of my work: her name along with my dad's in
that list of credits...and, to me, it's the only real credit that ever
mattered -- because without them I would not have the life they gave me,
the way they raised me... it is all a privilege I will never cease being
thankful for.

I never got to show her the movie that night. ""Mike!"" she called out from
the porch, in a pitch of voice I had never heard. ""Get your father! I don't
feel good."" She was, without warning, dying. Within 48 hours she would be
gone.

                 *          *          *          *          *          *

I'm walking through the Detroit airport to gate 75 for the flight to
Denver, and I hear someone say, ""OK, Mr. Stuckup, just walk right on by!"" I
turn to see it is one of anchors from the local TV station in Flint. I
apologize. My sunglasses are on. I have been crying since I left my dad at
the Flint airport. I explain this to her and she starts to get tears in her
eyes. ""My mom died in October,"" she says, and I realize that this pain that
feels so solitary is, truthfully, a shared experience amongst us all. No
one is immune from this loss. But instead of taking the time to tell me
about how rough it has been for HER, she asks about how I am doing and how
is my dad doing and did we get the flowers she and the others sent. She
gives me her number and says to call anytime if I feel the need to talk. At
that moment I remember what she told me -- that her mother also died this
year-- and I think, man, get over yourself, Mike, you are not alone in
this, and so I ask her how she is doing. ""I think a lot,"" she says, ""about
all the things she won't see my two children grow up to do, to be. But I
believe she is in my heart, right here, right now, and she will see it
all.""

They call my flight and I rush over to the payphone to call my dad to see
if he got home OK. He tells me that when he left the short- term lot he got
talking to the person in the tollbooth who told him about her mother
getting cancer and how she was caring for her. ""She said that her bill in
the hospital came to $60,000,"" he says with astonishment. ""They won't be
able to pay it. She makes six dollars an hour, no health insurance. I gave
her a tip along with the toll.""

""You gave the tollbooth worker a tip?""

""Well, you have to. That person could be you or me.""

That is my father. That was my mother.

246,"Re: The Curse of India's SocialismI think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with 
Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not 
exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.

Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) 
Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own 
""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more 
socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).

Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as 
well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the 
executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment 
community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They 
finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off 
hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.

So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?

What makes the non-free firmware question particularly interesting is
that the alternative is often to hardcode the functionality into the
hardware.  Now, if you had a board with completely closed HW, but that
presented an open, well documented interface for the driver, most
people would be very happy (although there are, of course, the open
hardware crusaders - more power to them!).  So, now that they've simply
implemented some of that functionality in SW, in the form of firmware
which the driver installs on the card, but which has nothing to do with
your host machine, are you really any worse off?

1497,"DANIEL  KARGBO. fork ! fork ,

From;Mr.David  Kargbou and Family,
         Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.
My name is Mr.David  Kargbou,the second son of Mr.Smith Thabo Kargbou,of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the la
 st undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.
During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00]in a Trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and bloc
 ked by the present Mugabe's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 
Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.David Kargbou and family.

This sounds like something piggy in the 'flist' code - I'm seeing flist

fast, there might be a borkedness in 8.4.

I've been seeing this as well - *usually* with inbox, but it's gotten
stuck on some other folders as well (I have procmail do rcvstore into folders

Yes, I am.  Everything is built inside a chroot.  I think it isn't linking

claims that European diseases were devastating to all American
hemisphere populations, and the reverse was never true.  Unlike, for
example, India or Asia.

There is a hot dispute about the original size of the indigenous
population, but the evidence for a high density in the Mexican area is
sound.  It was up here in the North or in the Amazon where I'm a little
more suspicious of very high upward revisions.

At least that was my take.

I have never heard anyone seriously argue that European diseases were
not a significant factor, or that there were not in fact a lot of Aztec
people prior to Cortez.  Gee, I've never before heard someone argue
unseriously about it either.

Do you have a reference for a book or article which does so?

Research Alert - Undervalued
August 26, 2002
XrayMedia
(OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8

Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! 

Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.

Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... 

Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weve never seen anything like it!

How does the company do this? 

XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a ""mass source to advertising sector "" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companys strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. 

Their ""source to business model"", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.

While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.

 *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.

*** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. 

*** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.

*** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.

*** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. 

*** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings ""substantially"" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.

Actually, it was worse - a bodycheck showed up a ""remove"" URL. I
need a new spam filter (but I want to be able to process false

I'm working with an experimental text recognition/processing engine that
exhibits similar characteristics.  It can read right through
misspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author
above suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.

If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything
like the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the
first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is
that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially
more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be
resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far
less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.

I know it's cold comfort, but this is the reason why people say  
""Before you do a major upgrade, always do a full backup.  And be sure  
you know how to do a full ""bare-metal"" restore from that backup, just

Our preschoolers (2 and 4) use Winamp with a Pokemon skin.  It's the
2-yr-old who figured out he could put it into a sidebar menu so all
he need do is click there to launch their favourite MP3 playlist.

What /we/ need is a good ""barely literate"" email program.  Years ago
the university of Hawaii had a word processor that included a
voice-assist and also would pop up menus for common completions as
words were typed; even further back there was a DOS shareware editor
that did that latter function extremely well (targetted at the
handicapped).  With just those little bits of assists, maybe some
clever use of pictograms too, I bet kindergarten kids could handle
email.

""Linux, FreeBSD, OSX and other OSs"" all of them include their own 
licencing model, whatever it is (closed or open sourced), so I can use 
the software knowing beforehand what I can (or can't) do with it.

The licensing model of Flash was (very) unclear for me, that is what I 
meant to say. And heck, it was recently ""opened"" (2008?) so it's a 
evolving license that could ""dissolve"" into something worse.

Do not get me wrong, I'm only saying that if I were a developer, I would 
have many doubts in choosing a flash format for any of my works.

Well, WFM.

Do you have a log of the shutdown messages that appear on the console?  The=
y=20
might tell us why your filesystem is not getting cleanly re-mounted read-on=

Yes.  Many, many more times.  A filesystem that can't grow is beyond useles=
s=20
for me.  Luckily btrfs support growing and shrinking and it can do both whi=
le=20
mounted.  On-line shrinking is a trick I couldn't get reiser3 to perform.

Well, I will still have to have a ""partition"" for GRUB to embed stage 1.5 i=
f I=20
go with GPT.  However, it won't contain files per se.  I like having as muc=

I have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  I
do get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand
from my father.

The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because
it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While it
is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a
consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not
something that was impressed upon them.

The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity
that exists separately from the individuals, typically an ""Indian
Corporation"" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a
single share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from
tribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the
tribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per
person, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number of
places, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and various
businesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.

You have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribes
are run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for their
share no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is very
high unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy
take their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from the
corporation often constitutes their sole ""income"" for government accounting
purposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one
works, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those
dividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because
they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies is
that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,
many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white
folk, not Indians.

Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also
receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation
to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  By
benefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other
ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.

It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are
ineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are
very smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good
credentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is the
Haida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has
billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have
gross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet the
dividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular
case, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before
drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to
intelligent investment and use.  They don't eat their seed corn, and have
actually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,
there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50
million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal
government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  This
particular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures
per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many
borrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,
the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand
dollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather
than their own pockets.

Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable
assets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously given
where feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign
companies.  And the cycle continues.

So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In a
nutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.

Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, and
gross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during
pregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very
substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many of
the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the
earliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On one
reservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many of
these societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is
arbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police
etc).

In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a
shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I
have ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren't
that many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that I
could tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unless
you'd seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, but
it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good
guys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,
if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as
a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are
openly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  It
will give you an interesting perspective on things.)

There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous
Indians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and
intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second is
where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if
they maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the tribal
leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological
cases mentioned above.

The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent
by the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite high
when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It is
just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to
ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  The
poverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was my
original point.


On a tangent:

One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal
corporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate
socialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use this
structure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what has
interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well
over the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.

It seems that in a future where ""familial"" ties will be increasingly
voluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western
society, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with
the included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting
individuals.

Damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.

This might appear as a very strange email. Maybe it is ;)

I'm french, and I'm currently studying in a engineer school in France,
called UTBM (http://www.utbm.fr). Next year, from February to July, I have
to do a practice somewhere in the world (in France or elsewhere).

I'm a Linux user and developer since a couple of years now (I coordinate the
KOS project, http://kos.enix.org). That's why I'm looking for a practice in
which I can use Linux and/or develop Linux/BSD Software. I also prefer
working in a small company (< 100 people). But since I've never been to
Ireland (that's why I want to discover this country), and since I have no
contact there, it is very difficult to find companies.

So, I thought that the local Linux community maybe was able to help me by
giving some list of companies that are known to work with Linux/BSD or any
other free software.

Thank you very much for your help

Vast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be Sealed

September 30, 2002
By JAMES GLANZ and ERIC LIPTON 




 

What is almost certainly the most sophisticated and
complete understanding of exactly how and why the twin
towers of the World Trade Center fell has been compiled as
part of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in
Lower Manhattan. 

Amassed during the initial stages of a complicated
insurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the
confidential material contains data and expert analysis
developed by some of the nation's most respected
engineering minds. It includes computer calculations that
have produced a series of three-dimensional images of the
crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,
helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to
the collapses. 

An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the
debris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been
accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what
government analysts have been able to put together as they
struggle to answer the scientifically complex and
emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly
failures of the buildings. 

But everyone from structural engineers to relatives of
victims fear that the closely held information, which
includes the analysis and the possible answers that
families and engineers around the world have craved, may
remain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. 

Bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the
experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they
wait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are
typical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it
now stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that
certain material can remain secret for the time being - has
approved standard legal arrangements that, should the
lawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial
material generated by the competing sides to be withheld. 

""We're obviously in favor of releasing the information, but
we can't until we're told what to do,"" said Matthys Levy,
an engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,
who is a consultant in the case and the author of ""Why
Buildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail"" (Norton, 2nd
edition, 2002). 

""Let's just say we understand the mechanics of the whole
process"" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. 

Monica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the
south tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper
Safety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed.
""If they have answers and are not going to share them, I
would be devastated,"" Mrs. Gabrielle said. ""They have a
moral obligation."" 

The lawsuit that has generated the information involves
Larry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the
trade center property, and a consortium of insurance
companies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner
that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist
attack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half
that amount, as the insurance companies say. 

As both sides have prepared their arguments, they have
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert
opinion about exactly what happened to the towers. 

Dean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of
Hartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said
of the findings, ""There are some confidentiality agreements
that are keeping those out of the public domain today."" He
conceded that differing opinions among the more than 20
insurers on his side of the case could complicate any
release of the material. 

As for his own company, whose consultants alone have
produced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of
diagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt
would be made to give the material eventually to ""public
authorities and investigative teams."" 

Still, some of that analysis relies on information like
blueprints and building records from other sources, like
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built
and owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in
the suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the
differing origins of the material would influence his
company's ability to release information. 

In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents
would be ""decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with
applicable law and policy,"" adding that it would cooperate
with ""federal investigations."" 

The fate of the research is particularly critical to
resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,
given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into
the buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few
resources, a lack of access to crucial information like
building plans, and infighting among experts and officials.
A new federal investigation intended to remedy those
failings has just begun at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has
studied many building disasters. 

Officials with NIST have said it could take years to make
final determinations and recommendations for other
buildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded
up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on
the lawsuit. 

Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of
the real estate executive's own heavily financed
investigative work, ""We decline to comment other than to
say that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST
investigation."" A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was
in discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but
said no transfer had taken place. 

With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by
both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body
of science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the
trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. 

""The work should be available to other investigators,"" said
Ramon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner
at Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier
inquiry. ""It could be used to build better buildings in the
future."" 

Legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one
governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,
from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such
information. In some cases, litigants who paid for the
reports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to
have them sealed forever. 
""It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep
some of those documents secret for one reason or another,
some legitimate, some not,"" said Lee Levine, a First
Amendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. 

Mr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the
information, the court might look favorably on requests to
make it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the
material is unnerving to many people, especially experts
who believe that only a complete review of the evidence -
not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect
their own interests - could lead to an advance in the
federal investigation of the trade center. 

""It's important for this to get presented and published and
subjected to some scrutiny,"" said Dr. John Osteraas,
director of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure
Analysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the
case, ""because then the general engineering community can
sort it out."" 

The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by
any measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger
Associates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called
upon powerful computer programs, originally developed with
the Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of
the Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. 

The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of
the severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged
core of the towers, beginning with the impacts and
proceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -
which Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped
pinpoint the structural failures. 

The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer
modeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to
the trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks
immediately after the attacks. But no such constraints
hampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to
the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of
Sept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a
consultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he
had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground
zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how
the towers fell. 

Though the FEMA team could not determine ""where things
actually fell,"" Mr. Cuoco said, ""we've indicated the
specific locations."" 

Mr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details
of the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details
of computer calculations his company has done on the spread
of fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.
Osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of
photographs and videos of the towers that day, some of
which he believes have not been available to other
investigators. 

And the investigation has not limited itself to computers
and documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind
tunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining
the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed
the weakening structures. 

Jack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort
Collins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but
had previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the
original design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. For
the legal case, Dr. Cermak said, ""we've done probably more
detailed measurements than in the original design."" 

""The data that have been acquired are very valuable in
themselves for understanding how wind and buildings
interact,"" Dr. Cermak said. ""Some of the information may be
valuable for the litigation,"" he said, adding, ""I think
I've told you all I can.""

That's an interesting sticking point. In reality, the probability of my 
accidental participation in distribution of the software is probably 
pretty low, but I can certainly see the principle involved.

That is most certainly my aim.

And, if I were stuck in a situation where I really, really needed to use 
(for instance) proprietary drivers so that I could use the 3D 
acceleration capabilities of the nvidia cards, or if I needed to use the 
wireless cards that require proprietary firmware, I'd do so -- though it 
would irk me a little bit, perhaps enough to goad me on into getting new 
hardware.

It's not a religion, but the ideas are important to me. And, as I said, 
I'm also just genuinely interested in seeing how well I can do without 
the proprietary bits. The resolve is made all the stronger by my 
experiences in industry where I see what I think are some pretty unwise 
decisions being made by companies who are often unwittingly tying their 
fortunes irrevocably to the whims (business models, I think they call 
them) of other companies -- companies whose interests might (and do) run 
in a counter direction.

The industries I've worked in might not have had very many choices (at 
least without incurring huge development costs) when making their 
hardware / software decisions. But, as an individual, I can do what I 
danged well please -- even if others may think that it looks like I'm 
just cutting off my nose to spite my face.

Eek.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't think that's a good idea. 
Outputting a message in %post and providing a README of some kind would
be better, as well as perhaps adding a note in %description.

It's the home pages of 62,179 computer scientists.
Mostly broken, but 50/50 on better title hits than DBLP.

One thing that's interesting is that for Google's
""Similar Pages"", only one homepage which returns the FoRK Archive is

include printer toner, home mortgages, and one for the origins of the
prime radiant[2] which I found out is an Asmiov concept.

The concept of a prime radiant is that there
is a single interconnected FoRKlist that ties a large number of

  Just so this isn't left hanging, the reason I say this shouldn't
happen is that it *used* to happen and I fixed it.  There were two ways
you could get broken holds, and I fixed one in version 0.4.11:

  * The aptitude dependency resolver will now refuse to adjust held
    packages or install forbidden versions unless you manually allow
    it to.  This behavior can be disabled by setting
    Aptitude::ProblemResolver::Allow-Break-Holds to ""false"".

    aptitude will still break holds when packages are being
    automatically installed; there is a pending patch against apt that
    eliminates this behavior.

  and the other in 0.5.9rc1:

  + [all] aptitude now uses the new hooks in apt to prevent the greedy
          resolver from removing packages or breaking holds.

          (Closes: #177374, #205049, #374353, #376802, #406506,
                   #430816, #434731, #442420, #452589)

  I am not, at present, aware of any other circumstances where aptitude
wrongly breaks holds.  That said, I don't put packages on hold very
often, so I depend on users to send bug reports if they're seeing that
behavior.

268,"Re: [VoID] a new low on the personals tip...-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I know it's not the popular choice for a lot of people, but I'd
suggest, um, church. :-). Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life is
showing up, right?


Almost anyone can find a church where the sermons don't make you bust
out laughing, and you're set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which,
as someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a
real church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70's bumper-sticker:
""Honk if you're not sure""; Lenny Bruce: ""Did you hear about how the
Klan burned a question mark on the Unitarian's lawn?""; ""Unitarians
would rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven
itself.""; ""Unitarians pray 'to whom it may concern'""; etc...)

But, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I'm, um,
lapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and
an agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe
or another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist
congregation is about as orthogonal to my present
congenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist
politics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist
bit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I
used to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in.
I'm asymptotically approaching my father's atheism, these days, and I
show up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a
civil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can't and end up arguing
with them. :-).


Anyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal.
I met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one
year after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married
her 2 years after that, and I wasn't even trying meet women. I was
just looking to make friends as I was new in town.


The trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation
you end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some
guys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don't. You can
practically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a
room...

That's because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most
regular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in
protestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age,
looks, intelligence, whatever, you'll end up surrounded by women.
You'll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at
least better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there
are *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics
- -- but I won't go there, I promise.


If I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure
that between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent's
religions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of
assimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near
you, Rohit. You probably don't even have to go, um, native, like I
did -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing
and becoming, horrors, a Unitarian...

Cheers,
RAH

Importance           : medium

python-clamav, which provides Python bindings to ClamAV, a virus scanning
engine, needed a recompilation with the newer clamav 0.95.3.  If you use
python-clamav directly or through nautilus-clamscan, we strongly recommend
you to upgrade to this version, as the old version the package was linked
against stopped working.


Upgrade Instructions
--------------------

You can get the updated packages at

http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile/pool/volatile/main/p/python-clamav

OK, noone has been tool-less for memory management for a LONG time. Most
systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that's how i've always
done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools
where you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.

Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the
hardware functions. Granted, this takes 30 minutes to go over, and so is far
beyond the scope of the ""Learn Java in 90 minutes without thinking"" book
every Java programmer learned from.

Parted is your friend! You can't do _everything_, the most limiting being

You're really better off backuping all placed where you know you've hand
edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and
/home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating ""/"", put your /home/ files
back into place and you're ready to go.
That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an
/etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change
again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,
because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in
/boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel
parameters to save (I have to pass ""pci=bios,biosirq"" for one of my
computers to work for example).

1330,"Re: [ILUG] Interesting article on free software licences

I have translated the article in full - see 
end of post (I think that I've done a far 
better job than the Google translation - at 
least it's readable now - any corrections
appreciated).

Stuff in {}'s is my (and others) additions 
to the debate.

My apologies if I've paraphrased anybody 
incorrectly, I will be glad to retract if 
anyone is miffed.



The article makes four main points.


1) Absence of critical clauses. 


In this case, the idea is that the licence 
is invalid because it doesn't specify
under what country's law the GPL is governed.


2) Specification in English only.

That for the end user (as opposed to businesses), 
the GPL doesn't apply because it's not written 
in French.


3) Arbitary licence change.

The point here is that (under French law) the 
author can change the terms of the licence 
arbitarily. This is because any granting of 
rights by an author must be clearly delimited
in terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and 
times. In the absence of such limitations, the 
original author has the right to change his 
software back to closed on a whim.


{

David Neary makes the point that the copyright 
holder automatically retains the right to change 
the licence.

Scott replies it simply requires authorisation from 
all *copyright holders*

That's not my understanding. French law allows a 
GPL type licence *_on condition_* that the 
specific conditions of the granting of such
rights are clear - if they are not, there is
nothing to stop the original author taking
back ""his work"". The lawyers see this
(correctly IMHO) as a weakness in the GPL).

}



4) Hidden defects.

Roughly, this clause means that the author(s) 
is/are liable for any defects if the consumer 
is not an IT engineer, so if Linux blows up 
and data is lost, then the authors are liable.


{

Ciaran Johnson says that M$oft and others have 
similar clauses - the point here is that they 
are *_all_* invalid - just that this one 
affects the GPL also.

Niall O'Broinn makes the point that it is not
a sale, but rather a service/leasing arrangement
and that's why it doesn't come under this point.

I would suggest that the whole thrust of this
article has been to see software ""sales"" (even
if no money changes hands) as governed very
much by consumer law (in France anyway).


Rick Moen makes the point that it is not
a sale but rather a granting of rights which
are not default. 

See the bit about even the granting of 
rights by an author having to be 
explicitly specified - under French law.


The fact that two IP lawyers in France think that
the GPL is covered as a sale make me feel that 
there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.

}



5) Roughly.

There may be other reasons under French 
law why the  GPL may be invalid.



-----  Whole Article. -----------


Freedom(a) is worth more than these 
imperfect licences.


Specialised lawyers look at the GPL.



Lawyer Cyril Rojinsky (duly appointed to 
the court) and the jurist Vincent Grynbaum, both 
specialised in the area of intellectual property 
examine the ""free"" licences and in particular the 
GPL. They have published their study
in the review ""Proprietes intellectuelles 
(Intellectual property)[1]"" and their
conclusion is grim.


Their approach is interesting. The problem for 
them is not to know whether freedom is valid under 
French law (for them the question is a moot point)
but rather they asked themselves about the form 
and the content of the text of free licences, and 
in particular the GPL. The problem is not free 
programmes, but rather the licence contracts of 
free programmes.



Absence of critical clauses.



The authors tell us that first of all, the 
reference to ""copyright"" is not legally 
sufficient in the framework of international 
contracts  (which is the case of licence 
contracts for programmes developed and spread 
via the Internet). The idea of copyright can 
basically include differences from one country 
to another. This is why, under international 
contracts, it is necessary to specify to which 
laws one is referring (French law, American &c.).

The authors only found three public licences 
which were correctly formulated on this point: 
QPL, IBM Public Licence and the Mozilla Public
Licence).



Specification in the English language.



Next, the authors remind us that (at least in 
France), no clause in a contract may be contrary 
to French law [2]. However, it turns out that a 
licence such as the GPL is contrary to French law 
in several respects. Firstly, it is written in 
English and the FSF doesn't officially approve 
translations. 

The ""Toubon law"" obliges this sort 
of contract to be written in French, including for 
businesses since the notion of ""user"" applies not 
only to consumers, but also to businesses, 
professionals &c. 


Contacted by the editors of LinuxFrench, 
lawyer Cyril Rojinsky declared that, as 
far as business is concerned, the ""Toubon 
law"" is probably doomed to change since 
it is in contradiction of European directives 
on the subject, but whatever about that, the 
problem is still valid for individuals, and 
while waiting for it (French law) to change, 
French companies have to deal with it, since 
it is the law of the land.


A programme under the GPL can suddenly 
change licence.


Another problem, much more serious, is 
that according to French law, the author of 
a free programme can, at any time, invoke 
the invalidity of the licence for this 
software by simply changing the licence.


In effect, the law of intellectual 
property stipulates that the granting of  
rights by the author is subordinate to 
the condition that each of these granted 
rights be the object of a distinct clause 
in the granting act (i.e. the licence) and 
that the granting of any such rights be 
delimited with respect to its scope and its 
grantees, and also with respect to its 
location (i.e. where such rights may be 
excersised)  and duration of any such grants. 
[3] This is not the case of the GPL nor of
other free licences. Briefly, this means 
that in France, or elsewhere if the author 
is French, that which is under the GPL could 
revert to proprietary from one day to the next. 
 


The problem of the guarantee ""hidden defects"".


An other very serious flaw is that of the 
guarantee. The GPL licences and others show 
that the software is delivered ""without 
guarantee"". You are going to immediately
reply that commercical programmes carry the 
same clause in their licence contracts,
and this is correct. However, whatever is 
written in a licence contract, one cannot
free oneself from the ""guarantee from 
hidden defects"", since it is imposed in the 
Civil Code. This concept is poorly understood 
by the layman, it protects the buyer
(whoever it may be, individual or business, 
since it specifies the Civil Code and not 
consumer protection law) against hidden 
defects, deliberate or made in good faith by 
the seller. 


For example, if one buys a pair of socks 
in a sale, and the shop has a notice 
specifying that ""Sale items are neither 
refunded nor exchanged"", and on arriving 
home you notice that one of the socks has 
a hole in it, several scenarios are possible.


You could have checked the socks before 
purchase: the flaw is deemed ""obvious"" and
you can sing for your money.


You couldn't check the socks (they were 
packaged for example), and in this case, 
despite the notice ""neither refund nor 
exchange"", you may invoke ""hidden defect"" 
and have them changed or obtain a refund, 
it's up to you. 

Personally, I have already invoked in shops 
the ""hidden defect"" clause and it always 
worked well (shopkeepers are always very 
cooperative if you quote a couple of words 
of the Civil Code). 


The concept of hidden defect is rather 
wide, it is necessary that you hadn't 
the possibility of discovering the defect 
before buying the product and then 
(according to the Civil Code) that you 
wouldn't have bought it at that price if 
you had known about the
defect.


The third case which is much rarer , is 
if you are able to show that the vendor had
knowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't 
inform you. In this case, not only does he 
have to reimburse the product, but all 
expenses incurred by the sale (metro 
tickets to go to the shop, the fuse 
which blew when you plugged it in &c.)


This idea of ""hidden defect"" applies to
 all products, including programmes. This 
was made abundantly clear by the 
authorities (and the courts) surrounding 
Y2K. 

This is particularly inconvenient for 
free programmes, since a site which 
offers a Linux distro for download is 
supposed to provide a guarantee against 
hidden flaws.


LinuxFrench asked Cyril ROJINSKY if 
in the case of a free programme, 
one could speak about a ""hidden"" defect 
since the source code was available, 
he replied ""Actually, concerning the 
guarantee, the question of obvious 
defect will arise. This analyis will 
be different depending on whether the 
person who downloads the distribution 
is an IT professional or not"". 

OpenSource has this advantage over 
the proprietary programme: it protects 
the distributor against a guarantee of
hidden defect insofar as the buy is an 
IT person. But, for distribution to the 
public at large, the problem remains 
the same.



Roughly Speaking.


Lawyer Cyril ROJINSKY said it himself, 
this study is far from being exhaustive 
and many other areas could be explored. 

During this interview, we asked ourselves, 
for example, about the fragility of the 
GPL clause which forbids linking source 
code under the GPL with proprietary code. 

In effect, the laws of intellectual 
property give the right to the user 
to modify a programme with the
intention of permitting interoperability 
with another programme. If for that,
I need to link with a proprietary library 
(communication protocol, device driver)
I may consider as ""null and void"" this 
clause of the GPL.


The conclusion of this study is a wake 
up call for the community. ""Freedom"" 
merits more than these shoddy licences, 
which should be modified before court 
cases over them proliferate and put at 
risk the undeniable originality of 
this effort.

CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY
AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN
MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER
DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO
CHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER
FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW
HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S
TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE
MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER,
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY
IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND
CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM EIGHTEEN MILLION
UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A
SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR
BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON

EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN

206,"Jakob Nielsen on Offshore Usability: ""To save costs, some
    companies are ouURL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020917.html
Date: Not supplied

Jakob Nielsen on Offshore Usability[1]: ""To save costs, some companies are 
outsourcing Web projects to countries with cheap labor. Unfortunately, these 
countries lack strong usability traditions and their developers have limited 
access -- if any -- to good usability data from the target users."" 

Offshore usability is a specific case of the general ""offshore design"" problem. 
Put simply, software teams are not successful when 
design or management are done in a different physical location than 
programming. Once I actually had a job where I was in New York, my direct 
manager was in Singapore, _his_ manager was in Hyderabad, and if I needed 
any management input I had literally no choice but to go to the CEO because at 
least he was awake during the same hours as I was. You can't get things done 
like this. A good project team relies on hundreds of small interactions a day. 
Here in the Fog Creek offices, we have 10 small conversations about FogBUGZ 3.0 
development every day. 

What I don't understand is people who think it's OK to move the developers ten 
time zones away from their managers and expect good results. Those same people 
would scream bloody murder if you told them that you were going to 
send the whole _management_ team to Bangalore or Beijing.

yep, I reckon that's likely.

BTW I'm hearing reports about problems resolving spamassassin.org.
Anyone else noticing this?  if it's serious I'll see if I can get
Mark Reynolds to add a 2ndary in the US, to go with the primaries
in Oz.

> >    - looks like there may be a razor2 issue

I think this is a Razor bug/glitch triggered when file permissions
don't allow its own log system to work.  At least that's the report
I heard on the Razor list in the past...

Theo, does it work now that you /dev/null'd the logfile?

> >    - version number (says ""cvs"")
> >    - tag tree as ""Rel"" this time too

I won't bother tagging with Rel, IMO; I don't think we should
rely on the version control system inside our code, so I've just
put a line in Mail/SpamAssassin.pm instead.   I will of course
tag with a release *label* though.

410,"This week: Deck, Tex-Edit Plus, BoomCNET | DOWNLOAD DISPATCH(Mac Edition)
July 9, 2002
Vol. 7, No. 27

Using a Mac and today's music software, musicians are finding
that they can create, record, and master their songs without
the need to pay for expensive studio time. Deck, our Pick of
the Week, offers a multitrack audio workstation that can take 
care of all your recording needs, and it's even optimized for 
OS X. Not just great for music, Deck can be used for film, video,
and numerous other applications. Get on Deck:

Also this week, we've got Captain FTP, for an easy way to
transfer files; AquilaCalendar, to get you organized under OS X;
Tex-Edit Plus, a full-featured alternative to the pricier
text editors; and Boom, a remake of one of the great classic
arcade games.

Enjoy!

2. Pick of the Week

   DECK
   Version: 3.5
   File size: 6.6MB
   License: Free to try; $399.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 9.x or Mac OS X

   Looking for a professional, multitrack audio workstation
   under OS X? This entry from BIAS, while maybe not the most
   attractive Mac app on the block, gives you some hefty
   editing functionality--whether you're working in broadcast,
   film, video, or any other multimedia environment. The big
   brother to BIAS' cheaper Deck LE, Deck 3.5 lets you process
   soundtracks, edit dialogue, spot effects, and record
   ADR-style voice-overs. Deck also supports surround mixing and
   up to four real-time effects plug-ins per track for music
   production. A good value, and one of the first of its kind
   to hit OS X, this midrange app deserves a listen. You're on
   Deck:

3. The Week in Wares

   IN INTERNET:

   CAPTAIN FTP
   Version: 1.3
   File size: 793K
   License: Free
   Minimum requirements: Mac OS X

   Designed completely from scratch to work with OS X, Captain
   FTP is a new client that makes finding, uploading, and
   downloading files online easier than ever. Since it makes
   full use of OS X's multithreaded multitasking capabilities,
   you can set up as many simultaneous connections as you like
   without slowing down other work on your Mac too much. The
   program supports drag-and-drop operation and resuming
   interrupted downloads. It also sports a built-in address
   book, and integrated BBEdit links. The interface deserves
   awards for clarity and good looks. Grab files in style:

   IN HOME AND EDUCATION:

   AQUILACALENDAR
   Version: 1.19
   File size: 1.63MB
   License: Free to try; $20.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS X

   One of the most frustrating things about off-the-shelf
   organizer applications is that they try to force everyone to
   keep track of things in the same way. AquilaCalendar is
   refreshingly different: you can design your own calendar
   windows, choosing from a plethora of basic options (day,
   week, month, year, several months together, and so on), customize
   your calendar with colors and fonts, and more. To-do lists
   and notes-to-self can be added to calendars or you can add a
   handy clock and holiday markers, among other options. The
   interface fits with the OS X design theme, and makes getting
   organized no more difficult than it has to be. Get organized:

   License: Free to try; $15.00 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: System 7.x

   Before you spend the big bucks on a HTML editor, make sure
   you check out Tex-Edit Plus. This handy little editor offers
   all the basics like unlimited Undo and Redo commands,
   translucent drag-and-drop capabilities, several text styles,
   and the option to highlight selected text. Also, you'll be
   able to use it to act as a text editor for an FTP client
   such as Fetch, Interarchy, NetFinder, or Transmit. Text
   editing made easy:

   BOOM
   Version: 1.3
   File size: 2.3MB
   License: Free to try, $15 to buy
   Minimum Requirements: Mac OS 8.x/OS 9.x/OS X

   Remember the classic arcade game Bomberman? Even if you
   don't, you should take this remake of the old classic for a
   spin. Maneuver your way through a maze of corridors while
   setting off bombs to clear a path for your escape. You'll
   also need to pick up coins for extra points and stay clear
   of those nasty aliens to stay alive. Blast your way through
   eight alien-infested areas, each one divided into 10
   subzones, and kick the Big Alien Boss back to where he came
   from. Blast away:

Actually, the ""x"" permission on a directory means ""search"" (i.e. find =20=

a file in) the directory.  If you already know the name (or have =20
guessed it) of a file in the directory and you have ""--x"" (no-read, no-=20=

write, yes-search) on the directory and 'r--' (read-only) on the file, =20=

you can read the file even though you can't read the directory.  =20
That's a feature, and it dates back to early days in UNIX.

What you are seeing is a corner case caused by that feature.  If you =20
have ""r--"" on the directory you can read it, but you can't find any of =20=

the files whose names you can read.  So you can't get those files =20
permission bits or mod-time's etc.  So ""ls"" fails in the bizarre way =20
you are seeing.

So you can ""read"" the directory without the ""x"" bit, but it doesn't do =20=

Note that many Debian KDE 3.5 installations include both QT3 and QT4,
e.g. to support kdebluetooth or lsb-desktop.

If you upgrade your RAM from 1GB to 2GB, KDE 4 feels about as fast
as KDE 3.5, except KDE 4 startup and KMail startup are still slower.

One reason for needing additional RAM seems to be memory leaks,
although whether in QT4 or KDE itself I don't know.

179,"Re: Dual Monitors Twin View on NvidiaOne possible solution is using the ""nvidia-settings""-Tool.
You can configure your display-settings in a GUI and save it  
permanently to an xorg file.
I'm using this method since years and it works very well and flawlessly.

CUT YOUR DESIGN COSTS AND TIME: Get access to 250+ Web Templates 
with CSS at BasicTemplates.com. 
Annual memberships are only $54.95. Individual templates are $5.00 each.

Somehow, it never got mentioned that Lockergnome has a GnomeTome for all 
you 
Dreamweaver users out there. Dennis Jarrett, a gnomie from the UK 
with a prolific list of writing accomplishments, lent his brain to a list 
of things everyone should know to make using Dreamweaver 4 (and newer) 
easier to use. I 've never actually used version 4, having stuck with 3 
until recently starting the review process of the StudioMX  suite, but 
I've been  able to apply every tip I tried to some aspect of DreamweaverMX, 
so I can only guess those of you using 4 will want to 
check 'em out too.

As I mentioned in yesterday's Digital Media newsletter, I recently 
switched cell phones to the 
Kyocera QCP6035. 
The unit is Palm powered, with a screen the size of an m105 and all the 
functionality of Palm OS, in addition to having the latest bells and whistles 
you'd want in a phone. Built in Web browsing, by way of MSN, is slightly 
cumbersome compared to what I'm used to from my cable connection, but I can 
already see the usefulness in carrying around portable access to things like 
driving directions. 

Now that I've got a way to test the final results in real time, I've got a 
more vested interest in making Lockergnome considerably more WAP compatible. 
I'm still figuring out many of the phone's features, so that's still going to 
be at least  a few weeks away. Without a doubt, I'll be sharing my experiences 
in WAPing Lockergnome in an upcoming series of articles.

&nbsp;GnomeMAIL
phpMyNewsletter

http://gregory.kokanosky.free.fr/phpmynewsletter/

As a free solution for managing newsletters, for smaller lists, 
this does most of what you need. Subscribers are stored in a 
mySQL database, with the ability to send user confirmation 
e-mails. Initially, the address must still be added manually to 
the database, which isn't idea, but doing this generates a 
confirmation e-mail with a link that users click on if they want 
to be added. The software purges addresses with no response, 
following an administrator defined waiting period. From the php 
interface you can send either text or HTML formatted messages, 
with a built-in preview to make sure your formatting is OK. 
Documentation is somewhat sparse, so prior knowledge of php and 
mySQL are useful in getting this installed.

OpalisRobot v4.0 [60MB] NT/W2k/XP

http://www.opalis.com

Think of this as something like ""cron for Windows"" only even more powerful. 
OpalisRobot allows you to schedule almost any process on your server, 
adding an additional layer of functionality, like the ability to program 
telephony commands to complete administrative tasks. OpalisRobot 
effectively processes e-mail commands, in addition to telephone DTMF tones, 
making everything on your server administerable from remote locations, 
even when you can't get remote control access of the machine. Programming 
jobs is point-click simple, saving you time even when you schedule tasks 
to save you time. If you operate in a Windows server environment, you're 
adding extra hours to your day and costing your company additional dollars 
by not having this software.

""If you browse to a Web page that contains an image that has a transparent 
background in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, the image background 
may appear to be gray rather than transparent.""

Fortunately, Microsoft explains a solution for this problem. Personally, I 
haven't encountered this PNG display error, but for those of you 
simplementing PNGs on your sites, you'll want to review the solution.

&nbsp;GnomeUSABILITY


http://diveintomark.org/

Not only is this information great for improving blog accessibility, it 
happens to be equally relevant for *any* site. The 30 days are nearing 
their end, which means you won't have to wait to find out what's next; 
you can simply click to the next page. Mark Pilgrim, the site's creator, 
sets the stage with 5 characters (all of which could easily represent 
real people) and walks through their physical, mental, and technological 
limitations. Following the character introductions, Mark walks through 
an accessibility scenario each day and then relates the concept back 
specific benefits for each character's limitations. Solutions are 
presented with blogs in mind, but with very little extrapolation you'll 
be able to make every site you design more user friendly.


&nbsp;GnomeBLOG
Backend.UserLand.Com

http://backend.userland.com/

I've been using Radio from the moment I finally got around to creating 
a blog. The software keeps things simple and automatically updates 
itself when new things get added. Userland goes far beyond creating a 
desktop interface for their blogging system though. They've fully 
documented all the XML, XML-RPC, and SOAP tie-ins used to connect to 
their network, which could easily be adapted to other content 
management applications with some XML knowhow. Backend is the place to 
look ""under the hood"" at Userland's XML inner workings, including 
detailed documentation on making everything work. If you've got 
modifications or improvements to the system, they have an open 
discussion forum for trading ideas.

how about applying this to the default apt.conf shipped with the
freshrpms.net apt package?  I found it a bit weird when the behaviour
changed between the old 0.3.x and the new 0.5.x versions so that when

174,"Re: video callback dataprocHi George,

I just figured what my problem was:

I first needed to get the raw pixels via:

CFDataRef data =3D =
CGDataProviderCopyData(CGImageGetDataProvider(image));
rawData =3D (unsigned char*) CFDataGetBytePtr(data);

and then I could create a QImage by using:

displayImage =3D new QImage(rawData,320,240,QImage::Format_RGB32);

I still have some color issues but at least I have my first positive =
result now.

Talk to you later,

So, do you have the two VGA cards enabled? I also have an Intel embedded 
card but IIRC, I disabled it in the BIOS as soon as I plugged the nvidia 
card (7600 GS).

OTOH, it seems that device ID corresponds to nvida 9400 GT. So I would 
test with the nvidia Debian drivers. If they do not work, you can always 
come back and activate the Intel one.

    I'm in your same shoes- I can get it upgraded and all, but I can never seem to work out where to start out with the thing; it strikes me as confusing!  But to be fair, I appreciate the pipline idea; just as it's useful on the commandline, it'll be emensely powerful for manipulating multimedia, too.    It's just not EASY yet.  I'm sure all kindsa glade-produced front-ends will come up for it soon, though.  And the docs are complete, too...

I did that yesterday, but seems like nobody bit.  Just in case , I

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Hi,

When compiling any .tex document using the route latex -> dvips ->
ps2pdf, I get a PDF. Normal, but the problem is that if I the PDF is
already opened (e.g. because I was reading the version of the document
before having modified and compiled it) when the compilation and the
whole process ends, the opened PDF is blank, i.e. the current page
becomes white, and every page I go at is white. If I then re-open the
document, I find the new version of my PDF.

I would like to know how this process actually works. For me, it looks
like the ps2pdf tool creates the PDF from scratch, and overwrites the
old PDF. But why am I receiving no warning message from acroread?
Anyway, acroread seems not to be locking the file, or, if so, ps2pdf
forces the writing.

Thanks.

1483,"[ILUG-Social] URGENT ASSISTANT NEEDEDDear friend,

I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this letter. 

This was in confidence considering my present circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my husband and two of our sons James Kongolo and Nzanga out of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Coted'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later died of cancer disease. However, due to this situation we decided to change most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new head of state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement with the Swiss government and other European countries to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in some european countries. 

Hence, my children and I decided laying low in Africa to study the situation
till when things gets better. Like now that president Kabila is dead and the son taking over
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in Southern France was confiscated by the french government, and as such I had to change my identity so that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State
Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate yourinterest that you can assist us in receiving the money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my son (Kongolo) who has the out modalities for the claim
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments as adviseby your good self. May I at this point emphasize the high level of
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,and hope you will not betray the trust and
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if you want to assist us, my son (Kongolo) shall divulgeto you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where
the funds are currently being maintained and also discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason kindly furnish us your contact information,that is your personal telephone and fax number for validation purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the above email address.

Yours sincerely,

Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.

I didn't say it wouldn't work.  I said it is unsupported.  There's
a difference.  Debian does make modifications to the kernel source.
The official Debian kernel source packages have been modified by the
Debian kernel team after downloading them from kernel.org.  There is
a reason for all of these modifications.  Often it's to prune ""non-free""
drivers from the kernel source tree.  But there may be other modifications
made for other reasons.  The Debian kernel team only supports their
own kernel sources.  If you obtain kernel source code directly from
upstream, and you have problems running it, you will have to seek
support and file bug reports directly with upstream kernel development.
You can't file a bug report against the Debian kernel source package
because it's not the Debian kernel source.  And you can't ask for
help from the Debian kernel team on their list because it's not
their source.  They will have nothing to do with it.  That's what
I mean by unsupported.

Hmm.. I've seen the *opposite* issue - if I go to *SEND* a signed message,
sometimes Exmh will put up the dialog box, but fail to set keyboard focus
there, so no passphrase can be entered.  Of course, hitting 'return' doesnt
work so you need to click the 'OK' box, at which point it finds that the
passphrase that wasn't entered doesn't work, and asks again, this time with
proper focus set.

I suspect some variable/codepath is getting hosed for the focus, or possibly
some borkedness with --no-tty and/or --status-fd flags to gnupg.

I'm not really sure if this is guarateed to work on all Java =

Of course. But the problems I had with Gnome and Xfce on this system 
occurred not only in Squeeze, but also when running an Ubuntu LTS 
version and Debian Stable. I only saw those problems when using the 
restricted / glx drivers. Never with nv or vesa. I think this is, 
perhaps, more a measure of the card itself than the drivers. But I know 
a number of people with ""high end"" graphics cards from nvidia who have 
reported the same sorts of issues that I saw. It doesn't really matter 
much as these particular systems are no longer used as graphics 
workstations. As they've aged we stuck Linux on them and use them as 
admin workhorses, a job for which they are admirably suited because of 
all of the screen real estate.

Yes. In my earlier experiences I would just wipe the drive and start 
over when I suspected that hangovers from previous experiments with 
drivers were getting in the way of new configurations. But after I 
became comfortable with a few different methods of installation and 
initial configuration I started paying attention to things like 
dpkg-reconfigure and debconf-show.

Which is what eject(1) is.  It will search mountpoints in /dev, /media and 
/mnt by default btw, so it's just ""eject sd[a-z]"" for your example.  You 
might want to use /media and volume names instead.

 Yes. Especially in the languages he was talking about - C, Pascal and
Assembler. Goto's can be used well; there are a few used in the kernel
code to improve efficency. They are almost required in some languages
(like C) where 'break' or 'continue' can't be told how many loops/switches
to break out of.

 But, in general, goto's make a mess of code.

 Recursion is only truely useful if you have an infinite stack. People
that think they have an infinite stack shouldn't be let near a compiler.

 I don't care, to be honest.

I've read articles which state that ext3 has superior resilience to
sudden power loss.  That sentiment has been echoed in this thread, by
Stan I think, with statements like (paraphrasing):  XFS is good for
production servers which have uninterruptible power supplies.

The resilience is due to the way the journal is written, if I
understand correctly.  Maybe somebody on this list who understands it
better can confirm or deny.  There is a journal_data_writeback option
for ext3 which will speed up writes to the filesystem, but reduce its
resilience to power loss.  With this option enabled, I recall reading
that the ext3 benchmarks are pretty similar to XFS.

I'm not an expert, so don't take my word for it.  Do some research on it
yourself, or wait for the real experts to chime in and correct me :)

OK, gotcha.

I don't think you can do that with exmh, but you can do it on the
command line, if you use sh or ksh:

	for f in `folders -fast -r`
	do
		echo sorting $f ...
		sortm +$f
	done

It could take a long time.

At work, I have to use Outlook.  Ick.  I hate it.  But it does a few
things right.  Like making indices for each folder, and not just by
date, but also by sender, message size, subject.  So I can sort by any
column instantly.

I believe this is possible, too, with an IMAP compliant reader,
provided the IMAP server makes such indices.

I am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry
standards.  I use it for my personal mail.  My mail server runs unix,
and I connect over ssh and tunnel my X traffic over ssh.  With a slow
link, this makes exmh very slow.  And mime handling is pretty bad
compared with modern mailers.  I am just scared to move.  I've been
using MH or nmh since 1985 and exmh since 1995.  17 years is a long
time!

183,"RE: [SAtalk] O.T. Habeus -- Why?Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with
spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in
other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.

Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after
regular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant
pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the
vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  So, I
can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers
down when it's never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records of
the business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records of
the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for
the whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes,
these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they're not
secret agents.  They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole
business is about finding them and putting them out of business

Habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark)
in a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole business
plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't
understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be
unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the
potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the
Habeas warrant mark.

Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on
your installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only
license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on
the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove
us from the next release.  But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it
has a chance to show any promise.

At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it
encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those
without SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the
transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't
steal any more cars.  But only if we're given a chance to succeed.

Haha!!!

Just a few notes:

 - It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone
   in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a
   good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law.

 - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court
   case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes!

 - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen
   cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc.

 - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I
   don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,
   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,
   ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly
   required for the spammer to get their way.

This could also be a job for P2P; lots of people would love to
devote their spare cycles, bandwidth, and unblocked IP addresses
to giving the Chinese unfettered net access.

In a sense, this is what the ""peek-a-booty"" project does:

   http://www.peek-a-booty.org

But let's play out the next few moves:

Good Guys: Google enables SSL access
 Bad Guys: Chinese government again blocks all access to Google domains
Good Guys: Set up Google proxies on ever-changing set of hosts (peek-a-booty)
 Bad Guys: Ban SSL (or any unlicensed opaque traffic) at the national firewall
Good Guys: Hide Google traffic inside other innocuous-looking activity
 Bad Guys: Require nationwide installation of client-side NetNannyish
           software
Good Guys: Offer software which disables/spoofs monitoring software
 Bad Guys: Imprison and harvest organs from people found using
           monitoring-disabling-software

...and on and on.

The best we can hope is that technological cleverness, by raising the
costs of oppression or by provoking intolerable oppression, brings
social liberalization sooner rather than later.

Subject: How about subsidizing SSL access to Google?


[a cheeky letter to the editors of the Economist follows, along with the
article I was commenting on... Rohit]

In your article about Chinese attempts to censor Google last week (""The
Search Goes On"", Sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most
subversive aspect of Google's service is not its card catalog, which
merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. By
maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire World Wide Web,
if you can get to Google's cache, you can read anything you'd like.

The techniques Chinese Internet Service Providers are using to enforce
these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from
Google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. Almost all
Web browsers, however, include support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. Upgrading to
SSL makes it effectively impossible for a 'man-in-the-middle' to meddle;
censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in
China. The only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of
IP addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in
the article.

Of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic
costs real money. If the United States is so concerned about the free
flow of information, why shouldn't the Broadcasting Board of Governors
sponsor an encrypted interface to Google, or for that matter, the rest
of the Web?

To date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on public-sector
programming for the Voice of America, Radio Sawa, and the like. Just
imagine if the US government got into the business of subsidizing secure
access to private-sector media instead. Nothing illustrates the freedom
of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself -- and most
of it is already salted away at Google and the Internet Archive project.

On second thought, I can hardly imagine this Administration *promoting*
the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. Never mind...

Best,
   Rohit Khare

===========================================================

The search goes on
China backtracks on banning Googleup to a point

Sep 19th 2002 | BEIJING
 From The Economist print edition

IN CHINESE, the nickname for Google, an American Internet search engine,
is gougou, meaning doggy. For the country's fast-growing population of
Internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving
an elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked
access to Google from Internet service providers in Chinaapparently
because the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to
forbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been
restored.

An unusual climbdown by China's zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More
sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to
use Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government.
Access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by
Google as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for
Chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.

After the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users
posted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move.
Their anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet
providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site
to far less powerful search engines in China.

Duncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm,
BDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to
censor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking
individual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be
filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key
words that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this
week when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on
Google for Falun Gonga quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China
usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. Such a search
also rendered Google impossible to use for several minutes."

306,"Blessing PeopleHi There,

I wanted to spread this good karma to you.

This is my true experiance. Six months back my shoe company was going bankrupt in a time of one month. I have no where to turn to. Luckily I met this guy Michael at www.blessing-people.com This is a non-profit web site. He really saved me. He started to chant for mine business without asking for any money when I told him my story. In just 10 days my business turn around. At the end of the month I could pay my monthly loan instalment. Thing steadily stabilized. Immediately I subscribe to his chanting servies. Those money Michael collected are for donation later in every year. I know I must have been creating good karma by subscribing to his prayers services. Now I am hunting for my second shop. Thanks to Michael.

I do not have any connection to him. I am just spreading this good karma just to repay what he had did for me. I deeply know what ever he did it's a miracle to me. Even until today all I know was Michael chant for me & many people.. And many miracle happened.

I am sorry if this email annoy you. I am not promoting Michael or my business this email can be clearly seen.

Please help spread this good karma around. Direct people to Michael. Creat good karma today for you future!

Battery pack, huh what???

You dont use batteries for a 1/4 mile run, you use capacitors. MANY times
the energy density, and you can get the energy out fast enough. Note that
the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run
anyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.
200 MPH should be no problem.

469,"[ILUG] Mutt reply hooks
Hi all,

I have 3 or 4 email addresses (which get used for different
reasons), and I'd prefer not to mix them up. So I was wondering
if anyone knows of a way that I can have mail (apart from list
mail, which I have already sorted) which arrives to a certain
e-mail address have the From: header in the reply automatically
set to the address it came to.

For example, say I have a company, and sales@company.com,
info@company.com and tech@company.com arrive in the same mailbox.
I don't want to reply to sales@company.com mails with the From:
set to dave@company.com, I would like the mail to come from
sales@company.com.

Is there any way to do this? Bearing in mind that mail can arrive
with my email in the To or Cc fields (and Bcc?), and it might be
buried in a couple of dozen other recipients...

Cheers,
Dave.

    From:        Chris Garrigues 
    Message-ID:  

  | hmmm, I assume you're going to report this to the nmh folks?

It turns out, when I did some investigation, that my memory of how MH
worked here was wrong (that's not unusual) - the -seq switch seems to
have always done -nolist (requiring a subsequent -list to turn it on
again).

Given that, I have no idea how the pick code as it was ever worked.  In
fact, it quite possibly never did the way it was intended to (I have just
been browsing the 2.5 sources, and that seems to be attempting to do things
that I never saw happen).

It may be that your new sequence method just exposed the bug that had been
there all along.

Given this, I won't be sending any bug reports to the nmh people.  If nmh
ever seems to be showing any signs further progress, and if I remember this
then, I might send them a change request.   The code to make the change is
trivial.

If you dislike Red Hat, why use it ? This was a really bad argument 
against using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that 
they 
a) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some 
sort of autodetection and changing crap)
b) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because 
formats have changed.

Red Hat is not ""taking it easy"" on this, it's putting control in the hands 
of you, the maintainer of the machine.  Don't be lazy.

You don't need to backup /home if you are careful enough.  You did put 
/home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use 
the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the 
data as is.

If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need 
to make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup 
and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over 
ssh.  It's the best way to make backups.

> These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! 

It's the other way around - your media files are backups of the CD's they 
came from ;)

Good luck,
Thomas

Yeah, I was thinking of the G4 keyboard when I wrote this. Otherwise lousy
feel and key placement, though. (That's why I'm holding on to my IBM Model

outlive several generations of computer hardware).

Very good for sticking in USB fobs into, though. CRTs/LCD panels are even

I think laptops are largely useless because of the battery and the

Naw, I still disagree, again because if I'm going to be so loose
with the definitions, then I'd have to say that I myself am a
genetically engineered organism.  But I'm natural, baby.  My parents
were attracted to each other's phenotypes, mixed some genes in the
hopes that those genotypes would get in there, and grew me around
them.  Sure, they engineered the process when they selected each
other.  But they didn't engineer the genetics.  If genetic enginering
wasn't such an important topic today, it wouldn't be such an important
distinction.

I guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing
against any checks on genetic engineering use that same argument -
""we've been doing it since prehistory, so we don't need to apply any
caution today"".

At this point, you only have two kernels installed; so there's nothing to
purge right now.  But be sure to add the optional flag to the LinuxOld
section in /etc/lilo.conf.  Without it, lilo will generate an error if
there are not at least two kernels installed.

Well, I already have, sort of.  The trouble is that it's buried in a
larger document on custom kernel building.  People see that and think,
""Oh, I'm not building a custom kernel; so I don't need to read this.""
But Step 10 on my kernel building page

   http://www.wowway.com/~zlinuxman/Kernel.htm

talks about customizing the kernel installation environment, and that
part is applicable to both stock and custom kernels.  The instructions

As I explained in another post, yes, it is in Sid.  If you need
instructions for how to pull in the Sid kernel without upgrading
your whole system to Sid, let me know and I can provide that.
Also, you might try disabling ACPI and try the vesa driver,
as explained in another post.

258,"[zzzzteana] FWD [UASR][TheHickmanReport] Jets Attempt to Intercept 'Contrail'Jets Attempt to Intercept 'Contrail' 

By ROBERT BURNS
AP Military Writer 



WASHINGTON (AP)--The military command responsible for the defense of North
American airspace scrambled fighter jets in response to unverified reports
of an airborne condensation trail, or contrail, moving from the Caribbean to
the United States, defense officials said Thursday. 

Lt. Col. Michael Humm, a Pentagon spokesman, said the incident happened
Wednesday and that the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado
Springs, Colo., was continuing to investigate. 

The reported contrail stirred concern because of the possibility that it
could have indicated the presence of an unauthorized jet aircraft in or
approaching American airspace. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the
Pentagon has taken greater precautions to monitor U.S. airspace. 

A contrail is created by vapor from a jet engine in the presence of cold
air. 

The jets that were scrambled to attempt to intercept and identify the source
of the contrail found nothing, said Lt. Cmdr. Curtis Jenkins, a NORAD
spokesman. He said NORAD had developed no new information since the initial
report at 4 p.m. EST on Wednesday. NORAD is reviewing data from its tracking
radars in search of evidence, he said. 

A Pentagon statement said NORAD received unverified reports of ``what
appeared to be a contrail of unknown origin,'' originally in the vicinity of
the Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. 

``Initially, it was reported to be heading northwestward toward the United
States,'' the statement said. ``Commercial airline pilots later reported the
contrail over Florida and later over Indiana. Thereafter, no other sightings
were reported.'' 

The reported contrail was never verified by visual or radar contact, the
Pentagon statement said. 

At the Federal Aviation Administration, spokesman Paul Turk said, ``I'm
aware of the reports.'' He referred all questions to NORAD. 

Jenkins said he was not sure who reported the initial sighting over the
Caribbean. He also was unsure who requested NORAD to launch fighter jets or
from which military bases they were scrambled. 

``We don't necessarily judge or second-guess when a request comes to us to
investigate'' a contrail, he said. 

Meanwhile, reports of a ball of fire streaking across the sky early Thursday
had people throughout the Northwest flooding radio and television stations
with calls reporting a meteor shower. 

It was believed that the light came from a Russian rocket body re-entering
the Earth's atmosphere about 6:15 a.m. The U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha,
Neb., and the North American Aerospace Defense Command confirmed a Russian
rocket fell back to Earth, but gave no further details.

848,"[ILUG] PPPD disconnects on me!Hello folks!
I'm new to Linux, so here goes...
I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem.
I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18.
I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driver
for it.
Minicom is very much able to dial out.
But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation.
When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial info
of my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal.
Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat.
I used this command:  pppd call Provider (where Provider is some script
somewhere).
It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connection
is established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits.
This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serial
port using pppd to connect ttyS0.  I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me
friend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.

Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of
having to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to
Linux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  It'd be nice never have
to go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).

Thanks a million.
Carlos

The extlinux package itself also contains an mbr.bin, which you can use

  Your message initially didn't have that link; so thanks for providing
 it.

  I think I over-reacted because I'm used to seeing people give
 lists of alleged problems in software, but without enough details to
 allow anybody else to confirm them, or investigate.
 Sometimes you'll get lucky and somebody else will report it; but posting
 to the users mailing list thing like:

    * I use software XX but it is buggy and now I use something else

  Just feels like a random rant, not the start of a useful or productive
 discussion.  (Which is pretty much what you did.)

  Indeed.  Still if it affects one site it probably affects others,
 unless it is caused by a particularly malformed
 HTML/javascript/whatever that site uses behind the scenes.

  On that basis its useful to report, if only so that other users
 of that particular site can see it.

  Even without that perhaps saving the page, and associated media
 to your local machine might still trigger it. If that is the case you
 can trim down the page(s) a lot and see if you can find out what causes
 it yourself.  (Assuming you're familiar with HTML & so on.)

Yup, I've been meaning to cobble together procmail + script for this, as 
a few Google searches didn't turn up anything. Did anyone here get there

(I guess I want a config file of mailboxes who normally sign their mail,

FWIW, the 'Enigmail' add-on for Mozilla's mail client has it happily 
talking to GPG (and I believe PGP). You can choose how long it remembers 
your passphrase for, default is 15 mins.

This feature was enough to get my off my Pine habit, since (to answer 
the original question) the combination of SpamAssassin and shared

Loo rolls of honour and the invisible man

Paper Clips: A round-up of the weekly press

By Steven McCaffery

The powers-that-be tell us that crime does not pay. And they found an 
ally in the Ulster Herald this week, which carries a cautionary tale 
for anyone thinking of embarking on a criminal career. The 
Omagh-based paper's 'As the Man Says' column brings a story which 
originated in the Middle East.

""A gent recently attempted to rob a bank in Tehran,"" the columnist reports.

""He was unarmed and began seizing bank notes from customers' hands.""

It is then explained: ""He had paid 625 to a local sorcerer and 
believed that he was invisible.""

In the Lurgan Mail there was also news of a dramatic robbery.

""A Lurgan newsagent has told how thieves drilled their way through 
three walls to steal 10,000 worth of cigarettes recently in an 
attack which was well planned and professional,"" the paper reports.

""The thieves broke through the back wall of a religious gifts shop 
next door to the newsagents and then drilled through the partition 
between the back hallway and the front shop.

""Moving statues of religious icons out of the way, the gang then 
drilled into the back of the newsagent's cigarette stand removing the 
contents.""

The owner of the Paper Chase shop is pictured next to the gaping hole 
left in his store and is quoted as saying: ""On Monday morning when my 
wife was opening, everything looked normal.

""But when she opened the shutters she found herself looking into the 
shop next door.""

The paper reports that the shop was the target of ""another well 
organised crime"" 12 weeks ago when thieves escaped with a safe.

The shop's owner says: ""The closer it gets to Christmas the more 
people are going to be open to this.""

The issues of crime and punishment are tackled by a columnist in the 
Down Democrat.

Writing in the Downpatrick-based newspaper John Coulter calls on the 
authorities to ""birch the vandals"" plaguing the local community.

He is shocked at reports of the ""wanton destruction by vandals"" and 
issues a call for action.

""The time has come to fight fire with fire,"" he writes, ""before 
unemployed paramilitaries decide to impose vigilante rule and start 
using so-called kangaroo courts to dish out their own brand of 
sentences on those found 'guilty' of anti-social behaviour.""

As an alternative to such reckless violence, he recommends, 
controlled violence.

""It was a sorry day that the Manx authorities banned the use of the 
birch as a weapon in dealing with unruly elements of the Isle of Man.""

Getting his defence in early, he immediately rounds on any woolly 
liberal who may oppose his plan.

""In many Islamic countries, public flogging of convicted criminals is 
the order of the day.

""You might laugh and say there is little chance of such measures 
being introduced in the United Kingdom or Ireland given that corporal 
punishment was abolished in the vast majority of northern schools in 
the late 1980s.

""However, people seem to forget that Islam is the fastest growing 
faith on the British mainland and it's only a matter of time before 
it numerically passes Christianity.""

Battered stocks regain ground
Led by a surge in chip titan Intel, beaten-down technology shares rose Thursday.

Despite a Merrill Lynch downgrade of Yahoo to ""reduce/sell"", the Internet portal rose after posting better-than-expected second-quarter results and also helped lift the sector. CNET's Tech index gained 29.87 points, or 3.11 percent, to close at 995.16. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index tacked on 28.42 points, or 2.11 percent, to close at 1,374.43--after hitting a five-year low Wednesday.

Broader markets were mixed amid news wholesale prices rose slightly and drug firm Bristol-Myers Squibb is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.0 points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 8,801.5. The S&P 500 added 6.9 points, or 0.75 percent, to close at 927.37, after it too reached a five-year low Wednesday.















With rebates, HP angles for PC sales 
Hewlett-Packard is trying to beat the heat with summer deals on PCs.
For retail buyers in the United States, the company is offering several new rebate or promotional programs, designed to stimulate demand for its PCs, going into the back-to-school shopping season. Some of the deals include a new $200 mail-in rebate on desktops, while others offer instant $50 rebates.HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 15.23 -0.13% 

Shareholders sue PayPal, eBay 
The PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.
The lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.EBAY INC 60.38 2.63% 

SAP cuts forecast, shows Q2 loss 
Europe's biggest software maker, SAP AG, shocked the market on Thursday by unexpectedly cutting its sales forecast and missing analysts' forecast for the second quarter.

The company said it would post a net loss of 235 million euros ($232 million) and said it was taking a non-recurring accounting charge of 414 million euros to cover impairments of minority investments in the United States, including a 318 million euros charge from its 20 percent stake in Commerce One.SAP AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT ADS 19.70 -7.73%

Merrill Lynch downgrades Yahoo in report 7/11/02 
Analysts Justin Baldauf and Tim Gernitis cut their intermediate-term rating on the Internet giant from ""neutral"" to ""reduce/sell"" and their long-term rating from ""strong buy"" to ""neutral"" after seeing Yahoo's second-quarter results. Although the results look solid at first, Baldauf and Gernitis say Yahoo's growth was driven entirely by new initiatives. They also argue the firm's improved outlook seems driven completely by the Overture deal extension. Eventually, these initiatives will result in much lower growth rates, the analysts say.

Parted is your friend! You can't do _everything_, the most limiting being
that you can't move the start of a partition, but it's quite powerful
nevertheless, and I've been very happy with it the few times I've had to
use it.

You're really better off backuping all placed where you know you've hand
edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and
/home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating ""/"", put your /home/ files
back into place and you're ready to go.
That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an
/etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change
again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,
because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in
/boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel
parameters to save (I have to pass ""pci=bios,biosirq"" for one of my
computers to work for example).

HTH,
Matthias

nv obviously won't immediately stop working, but as x.org releases

563,"getting inetd to run leafnode via IPv4Some time ago, my slrn stopped being able to talk to my local news
server, and I'm just now trying to troubleshoot it.  I suspect this has
a really obvious answer, but because I'm not at all familiar with IPv6,
I'm not seeing it.  I'm running sid, mostly up to date.

Apparently, the problem is that inetd has leafnode listening on IPv6,
but not on IPv4.  I think I need to either get slrn to work with IPv6,
or get leafnode listening on IPv4.  Actually I'd like to know how to do
both.  I'd very much appreciate any pointers you can give me.

	$ netstat -l | grep nntp
	tcp6       0      0 [::]:nntp               [::]:* LISTEN

	$ telnet :: 119
	Trying ::...
	Connected to ::.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	200 Leafnode NNTP Daemon, version 1.11.7 running at ip6-localhost (my fqdn: a.b.org)

	telnet localhost 119
	Trying 127.0.0.1...
	telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused

This is surprising, because I thought you had to specifically tell
inetd to use IPv6.  My inetd.conf has this line:

nntp stream tcp nowait news /usr/sbin/tcpd /usr/sbin/leafnode

... but neither loosening my /etc/hosts.* files nor removing tcpd from
the loop seems to help.

I'm a total newb regarding IPv6.  Currently my environment has:
	NNTPSERVER=localhost
... which some time ago allowed slrn to read from the local news server.

Changing to 
	NNTPSERVER=::
does not satisfy slrn:
	Connecting to host  ...
	Failed to resolve

Any suggestions?

If what you say is true, then he is wasting his time (and ours) by posting
to *any* list.  If he can
only receive e-mails from fellow Cubans, then even if there are fellow
Cubans who could help him and are subscribed to the list, they will never
receive his posts, since the list server is outside of Cuba.  In fact,
no-one in Cuba could even subscribe to the list, since they will never
receive the confirmation e-mail.  And if they don't have web access
either, then posting to *any* list is an exercise in futility for Cubans.
Lists are black holes to Cubans.  Everything goes in, nothing comes out.
Apparently he hasn't figured that out yet.

1582,"Get Paid For What You Know                         18436
OPRAH, NIGHTLINE, MARIA SHRIVER, 48 HOURS, 20/20, 
PLAYBOY, KIPLINGERS and more have all interviewed this 
FAMOUS Private Investigator, seeking to find how he made 
his fortune.  Take a moment and learn his long sought after SECRETS.

This PI is the originator of seeking out Judicial Judgments and using 
them to make a FORTUNE!  Most people have no idea what a 
Judicial Judgment is, much less how to process them to earn a very 
substantial income.

Heres the SCOOP-  When one person or business files suit against 
another and wins, the winner then has a JUDICIAL JUDGMENT.
BUT, even though they won- guess what? They soon find out these 
SHOCKING FACTS:

a) Its now up to them to Collect on the Judgment
b) The court does not require the loser to pay you. 
c) The court will not help you to collect it. 
d) Employees of the court are FORBIDDEN BY LAW from telling 
you how to collect the judgment. 

All the winner really has is a WORTHLESS piece of paper. They 
must trace the loser down, find their assets; their employment, bank 
accounts, real estate, stocks and bonds, etc. And THE WINNER 
has to pay all the expenses to find this out.  All of a sudden that 
BIG CASH SETTLEMENT the person got, has become an 
expense instead of an asset!  

WHAT HAPPENS THEN?- MILLIONS of Judgments just sit in 
files and become forgotten. people give up trying.  Right now in the 
United States there are between 200 and 300 BILLION dollars of 
uncollected JUDICIAL JUDGMENTs. For every Judgment that is paid, 
5 or more unpaid Judgments take its place. 

So how does this Private Investigator make a FORTUNE collecting 
other peoples judgments?  Thats what we want to tell you.  
Through long and hard work, this Sleuth has learned a 
process that will turn these forgotten useless pieces of paper 
into a FORTUNE without the high collection cost.

The income potential is substantial in this profession! Using the 
techniques taught in his course , people are now working full-time 
making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per year. Part-time 
associates are earning between $24,000.00 and $100,000.00 per 
year. Most choose to work out of their homes, others build sizable

Just see which process is running pstree.
""ps -eaf | grep pstree""
You could find the parent pid of pstree (second column).
Look at the parent of pstree, and the process started this one.
If you go back that way, finally you will reach init, but before that you
could
find which system process started these processes."

Oh, neat.

I have similiar thing in my hands, though it might be migratable if I
had the time to try. I've been using another 6.x repository though.
http://apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org/apt

Anyone tried (dist-)upgrade from 6.x to 7? Theoretically it should drop
in some -compat's (notably libc) and upgrade the rest and after a reboot
and maybe a new kernel (and grub, but I have long before put those to
v6's :) run just fine. Haven't had a spare machine to try it on myself,
though.

[001] - abcm2ps 3.1.1 (Development)
  by Guido Gonzato (http://freshmeat.net/users/goccia/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 03:48

Multimedia :: Sound/Audio :: Conversion

About: abcm2ps is a package that converts music tunes from ABC format to
PostScript. Based on abc2ps version 1.2.5, it was developed mainly to
print baroque organ scores that have independant voices played on one or

About: The dump package contains both dump and restore. Dump examines
files in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be backed up, and
copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium. The
restore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can restore a
full backup of a filesystem. Subsequent incremental backups can then be
layered on top of the full backup. Single files and directory subtrees may
also be restored from full or partial backups.

Changes: This release fixes a bug (introduced with 0.4b29) which prevented
the use of a remote tape drive.

the install was made from a normal package. Unlike other similar products,
IPFS is able to track both shared and statically linked programs. A
Slackware 8.1 package for IPFS is available for download. 

Changes: The old resolve_path shell script has been replace with a newer
and faster ipfs_realpath coded in C.

[046] - Lindenmayer Systems in Python 1.0 
  by Eleventh Hour (http://freshmeat.net/users/xihr/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 17:52

Scientific/Engineering :: Artificial Intelligence
Scientific/Engineering :: Mathematics
Text Processing :: General

About: Lindenmayer Systems in Python provides a simple implementation of
Lindenmayer systems (also called ""L-systems"" or ""substitution systems"").
In basic form, a Lindenmayer system consists of a starting string of
symbols from an alphabet which has repeated transitions applied to it,
specified by a list of transition search-and-replace rules. In addition to
the standard formulation, two alternative implementations are included:
sequential systems (in which at most one rule is applied) and tag systems
(in which the transition only takes place at the beginning and end of the
string). Despite being implemented entirely in Python, for reasonable
rules on a modern machine, the system is capable of running thousands of
generations per second. Lindenmayer systems are found in artificial
intelligence and artificial life and can be used to generate fractal
patterns (usually via mapping symbols from the alphabet to turtle
commands), organic-looking patterns that can simulate plants or other
living things, or even music.

Software Development :: Libraries
System :: Operating System
Text Processing

About: OSSP cfg is a ISO-C library for parsing arbitrary C/C++-style
configuration files. A configuration is sequence of directives, each
directive consists of zero or more tokens, and each token can be either a
string or again a complete sequence. This means the configuration syntax
has a recursive structure and allows you to create configurations with
arbitrarily-nested sections. The configuration syntax also provides
complex single/double/balanced quoting of tokens,
hexadecimal/octal/decimal character encodings, character escaping, C/C++
and shell-style comments, etc. The library API allows importing of a
configuration text into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), traversing the AST,
and optionally exporting the AST again as a configuration text.

About: OSSP fsl offers the syslog API otherwise provided by libc. Instead
of writing to the syslogd process, it uses the powerful OSSP l2 logging
capabilities. It is a drop-in link-time replacement which enables any
syslog consumer to take advantage of OSSP l2 by just linking this library
in before libc. The program is intended to apply OSSP l2 functionality to
existing syslog-based third-party programs without the requirement to
change the source code of the program.

Software Development :: Libraries
System :: Logging

About: OSSP l2 is a C library providing a very flexible and sophisticated
Unix logging facility. It is based on the model of arbitrary number of
channels, stacked together in a top-down data flow tree structure with
filtering channels in internal nodes and output channels on the leave
nodes. Channel trees can be either constructed manually through
lower-level API functions or all at once with a single API function
controlled by a compact syntactical description of the channel tree. For
generating log messages, a printf-style formatting engine is provided
which can be extended through callback functions. The data flow inside the
channel tree is controlled by logging message severity levels which are
assigned to each individual channel.

[062] - Papercut NNTP Server 0.8.3 
  by Joo Prado Maia (http://freshmeat.net/users/jcpm/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 00:34

Communications :: Usenet News
Software Development :: Libraries :: Python Modules

About: Papercut is a multi-threaded NNTP server written in Python. Its
main objective is to integrate existing Web-based message board software
(Phorum on the first few versions) with a Usenet front-end. However, its
extensibility enables developers to write their own container for the
storage of the Usenet articles (messages). That means that the code is
extensible enough that you could write new containers to integrate the
news server with other Web message board projects or even other ways to
store the messages. 

Changes: The various storage modules have been redesigned, and initial
code for NTTP authentication was added. New features include a standalone
MySQL storage module with no Web front-end, an authentication module for
Phorum, and the concept of a 'read-only' / 'read-write' server with
password protection. Most (if not all) of the features are working.

display files, allowing you to template most of the frontend, and allowing
you to specify an already existing user table. Also included is a DBI for
portability, ANSI SQL for portability, an advanced and documented API,
full multilingual support, and full i18n support for date functions. 

Changes: This release has migrated to PEAR. It has an expanded API, major
code cleanups, increased i18n support, and many minor bugfixes.

About: phpTest is a Web-based testing program. It provides an environment
to take multiple choice or true/false quizzes. It is designed to be
modular and flexible. An administrator can add any number of questions,
tests, users, and groups. Once a test is created, a user can log in to
take the test, and his test results are scored automatically and stored in
the database for easy viewing. It includes features designed to prevent
cheating, such as randomization of questions on tests, and security
logging for unauthorized access to pages.  

Changes: Options have been added to limit the number of times someone can
retake a test, to not let someone retake a test once they've passed it,
and to allow html in questions. Many bugs have been fixed.

  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 10:48

Communications :: Ham Radio

About: The station-info program searches for and displays AM, FM, and TV
station entries from databases supplied by the US Federal Communications
Commission (FCC). It provides many ways of selecting a collection of

antenna radiation pattern, ownership information, and whatever else seems
useful.  

Changes: This release adds correct displaying of antenna patterns
(previously, they were shown rotated, reversed, and upside down). It also
adds a compass rose and the station callsign to the antenna pattern
display. It accepts station callsigns as location specifications. It
avoids trying to draw in details windows that have been closed. All the
cdbs and .loc files have been moved to $PKGDATADIR (by default,
/usr/local/share/station-info/).

  by sigra (http://freshmeat.net/users/sigra/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 23:04

Software Development :: Testing

About: Valgrind is a tool that helps you find memory management problems
in programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all reads
and writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are
intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can detect problems such as use of
uninitialized memory, reading/writing of memory after it has been freed,
reading/writing off the end of malloced blocks, reading/writing
inappropriate areas on the stack, memory leaks in which pointers to
malloced blocks are lost forever, passing of uninitialized and/or
unaddressable memory to system calls, and mismatched use of malloc/new/new
[] vs. free/delete/delete []. 

Changes: Support for the x86 fldenv instruction, a fix for an obscure
optimiser bug causing failures like this: ""insane instruction 27: PUTFL
%ecx"", a fix for dying with bus errors running programs which mess with
the x86 AC (alignment-check) flag, fixes to make it compile and run on Red
Hat ""Limbo"" (7.3.92), a fix for a possible assert failure having to do
with free() when running cachegrind (not valgrind), and final manual
adjustments.

Communications :: Email :: Mail Transport Agents
Communications :: Email :: Post-Office :: POP3

About: vpopmail (vchkpw) is a collection of programs and a library to
automate the creation and maintenance of virtual domain email
configurations for qmail installations using either a single UID/GID or
any valid UID/GID in /etc/passwd with a home directory. Features are

It supports MySQL, Sybase, Oracle, LDAP, and file-based (DJB constant
database) authentication. It supports SMTP authentication combined with
the qmail-smtp-auth patch. It supports user quotas and roaming users (SMTP
relay after POP authentication). 

Changes: This release adds one last patch for the vgetent problem,
comments out the lseek definition for BSD users, replaces the old
qmail-pop3d-maildirquota patch with the qmail-maildir++ patch (which adds
Maildir++ support not only to qmail-pop3d, but also to qmail-local), and

  by Nevyn (http://freshmeat.net/users/nevyn/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 00:14

Software Development :: Libraries

About: Vstr is a string library designed for network communication, but
applicable in a number of other areas. It works on the idea of separate
nodes of information, and works on the length/ptr model and not the
termination model a la ""C strings"". It can also do automatic referencing
for mmap() areas of memory, and includes a portable version of a
printf-like function.

Changes: The vstr_export_buf() function now performs automatic bounds
checking in the same way as vstr_export_cstr_buf(). vstr_sc_read_*() now
works even if the vstr isn't configured to have an iovec cache. Work on
internal symbol hiding has been made, making the library smaller and
faster.

[100] - WebFileManager 0.972 (Stable)
  by horsburgh (http://freshmeat.net/users/horsburg/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 16:56

Desktop Environment :: Window Managers
Internet :: WWW/HTTP :: Site Management

About: FileManager is a secure (SSL), multi-user, and Web- based program
for file, directory, and remote  command management. It is written in
Perl, for  Linux and Unix-like operating systems. It displays  full
directory information; allows file viewing,  deleting, renaming,
uploading, downloading, etc.;  assists in directory navigation; and can
execute  any command for which the user account has  privilege.
FileManager also comes with a built-in  text editor for quick editing and
file updates. 

Changes: A security hole that allowed authorized users to view any file on
the system has been fixed. The security certificate has been extended.
Support has been added for 29 more OS types. The find function now works
for non-root, jailed users. A new option controls whether or not a user
can ""click"" outside their home directory tree. The AllowRootUser parameter
can now disable the 'root' user. A bug that prevented non-root, jailed
users from creating subdirectories, a ""group"" permissions access problem,
and a bug in the ""Command Line"" box which prevented using the asterisk
wildcard have all been fixed.

  by Klayton Monroe (http://freshmeat.net/users/mavrik/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 13:19

Security
System :: Monitoring
System :: Systems Administration

About: WebJob downloads a program over HTTP/HTTPS and executes it in one
unified operation. The output, if any, may be directed to stdout/stderr or
a Web resource. WebJob may be useful in incident response and intrusion
analysis as it provides a mechanism to run known good diagnostic programs
on a potentially compromised system. It can also support various
host-based monitoring solutions. 

Changes: Under the hood, the project went through some significant
restructuring, primarily to make room for three new platforms: NT/2K,
Cygwin, and MacOS X. The default installation directory has changed for
Unix platforms (it is now in /usr/local/integrity).

[105] - XMLtype 0.5.1 (Development)
  by Jiri Tobisek (http://freshmeat.net/users/tobich/)
  Tuesday, July 30th 2002 18:39

Text Editors

About: The goal of the XMLtype project is to create a console-based editor
of XML document-oriented files in UTF-8 encoding. It is designed from the
beginning for multilingual use, even for writing bi-directional texts
(e.g. mixed English and Hebrew). The design focuses on comfortable and
fast typing of well-formed XML documents. Thus XMLtype is not meant to
compete with advanced console editors like Emacs or VIM. For full
functionality, XMLtype requires UTF-8 console support. It is being
developed under Linux and for the ANSI/VT-100 terminal. 

Changes: This release fixes an ugly I/O bug caused by previous bugfixing.

TVPredictions.com Newsletter (August 7, 2002)
The #1 Newsletter on the Future of TV

Hi Everyone,

First of all, I want to welcome those
subscribers who are getting this newsletter
for the first time. Here you will find 
hard-hitting commentary and analysis
on issues related to the future of television.
Whether it's Interactive TV, the battle between
the cable news networks, the latest in 
the Emmy race, or the federal government's
fight to promote HDTV, TV Predictions will 
give you the scoop -- before it actually 
occurs. And, as long-time subscribers
will tell you, we pull no punches. 

(FYI -- TVPredictions.com, based in Los 
Angeles, is owned and managed by Phillip Swann,
author of ""TV dot Com: The Future of 
Interactive Television."" He has been 
quoted as an expert on TV issues in publications
such as The Hollywood Reporter, Variety and 
Electronic Media.) 

Now, in this issue, we offer an all-new edition of...
the Interactive TV Power Rankings! Plus: Why TiVo
desperately needs to boost its sub numbers during
the next five months. And, the latest news on 
the future of TV.

TiVo: Now or Never?

Ready for this?

The next five months could determine whether 
TiVo, the Personal Video Recorder service,
ultimately survives as a business.

TiVo, which launched five years ago, has less 
than 500,000 subscribers. The company's stock
dipped below three this week. And network execs
are openly questioning whether the digital recorder,
which permits skipping commercials with a few 
clicks of the remote, will destroy their advertising
models. There even have been hints that the 
networks could support a move by the cable 
industry to offer a PVR that does not permit
commercial skipping. And that PVR would not 
be a TiVo. 

To its credit, TiVo has been remarkably successful 
at building brand loyalty and awareness. TiVo 
reports that 97 percent of its subscribers have
recommended the service to a friend. And when
people talk about PVRs, they say TiVo. (Just 
like the way people say ""Coke"" when they talk
about soft drinks. )

But Wall Street, the media and the industry 
are all growing impatient. TiVo needs to start
putting some big numbers on the board -- 
and it needs to do it this holiday season. If 
it doesn't, stock analysts who have supported TiVo 
until now will run for the hills. That will push
the company's stock price down even further. And
if that happens, TiVo could have just two choices:
Sell the company under duress or wait until its 
funding dries up. 

Consequently, I predict that TiVo will launch 
an intensive marketing blitz over the next 
five months, right through the holiday season.
The blitz will include a sharp increase in 
retail distribution, TV advertising and PR 
efforts. The company needs to show Wall 
Street -- and the industry -- that it will be 
the brand leader in the PVR category. And it
needs to show that it can generate
mass consumer demand. 

How does TiVo demonstrate that?

Anything short of 750,000 subs at year's end
will have people questioning whether TiVo has
the right stuff. Cable execs, who are watching
TiVo closely, might decide that adding the 
service is not such a great selling point 
after all. And Echostar, which currently does
not have an agreement with TiVo, may decide
to stay with its unbranded PVR service after 
its merger with DIRECTV is approved in D.C. 
(TiVo currently has a partnership with DIRECTV,
but it's unclear what will happen to the deal if 
the merger is approved.) 

So there is much at stake -- and it's not extreme
to say that TiVo's ultimate future could be decided
in the next several months. 

Will it succeed? I predict that TiVo will achieve
a partial success. The company will boost its 
subscriber numbers and it will maintain its claim
as the #1 PVR service. However, in time, I 
also predict it will decide to sell the company
to a large media outfit, such as Sony or perhaps
even Liberty Media. This would give TiVo the 
necessary funding and industry connections
for long-term growth and survival.

The ""--define"" is exactly what I was looking for! I was trying to
figure out a way to do it within the mechanism of rpm (like the
""--with"" switches), but for some reason didn't think of using
""--define"". My computer is currently gone for repairs, but once it's
back, I'll rewrite the specfile, add support for kernel-smp, and email
it to the list for further criticism :)

As far as requiring kernel-source, I don't feel it's a big problem. If
you're gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms,
it's not a far stretch to package the source tree too (as I currently
do).

Also, I've found that the alsa-driver source needs a usb-related patch 
to compile under the latest test kernels (2.4.20-preX). Are other 
people seeing the same thing, or is this just a problem with my setup?

gary

P.S. If I didn't mention it before, thanks for the alsa packages! They 
greatly simplified what used to take way too long before.

Yep, I see nothing strange in there.

I would start Cyrus setup and user migration from scratch to avoid any

Date: Not supplied

This time around, we have _two, two, two_ Guestbloggers for the price of one. 
Quinn Norton and Danny O'Brien have agreed to fill the sidebar slot for a 
little while. Danny and Quinn and their rommie Gilbert are just about the most 
fun Bay Areans I've had the pleasure of hanging out with. Between the three of 
them, they're capable of being entertaining on the subjects of Python, 
copyright, pottery, usability (a conversation with Quinn about usability made 
it, almost verbatim, into my second novel ""Eastern Standard Tribe""), 
load-balancing, free software, nerd culture, British cuisine, bodily ailments, 
pregnancy... Well, you name it. I can't wait to see what they post! Discuss[1]

I'm really thinking of starting a project to prolong the life of kde3.

we could really do what SUSE has been doing all the time and put kde3 into

Tassos Papadopoulos, the Greek sculptor behind the plan, judged that the
 limestone of Mount Kerdylio, 70 miles east of Salonika and not far from the
 Mount Athos monastic community, was ideal for the patriotic sculpture. 
 
 As well as Alexander's granite features, 240 ft high and 170 ft wide, a
 museum, a restored amphitheatre and car park for admiring crowds are
planned
---------------------
So is this mountain limestone or granite?
If it's limestone, it'll weather pretty fast.

    From:        Chris Garrigues 
    Message-ID:  


  | I can't reproduce this error.

For me it is very repeatable... (like every time, without fail).

This is the debug log of the pick happening ...

18:19:03 Pick_It {exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace} {4852-4852 -sequence mercury}
18:19:03 exec pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace 4852-4852 -sequence mercury
18:19:04 Ftoc_PickMsgs {{1 hit}}
18:19:04 Marking 1 hits
18:19:04 tkerror: syntax error in expression ""int ...

Note, if I run the pick command by hand ...

delta$ pick +inbox -list -lbrace -lbrace -subject ftp -rbrace -rbrace  4852-4852 -sequence mercury
1 hit

That's where the ""1 hit"" comes from (obviously).  The version of nmh I'm
using is ...

delta$ pick -version
pick -- nmh-1.0.4 [compiled on fuchsia.cs.mu.OZ.AU at Sun Mar 17 14:55:56 ICT 2002]

And the relevant part of my .mh_profile ...

delta$ mhparam pick
-seq sel -list


Since the pick command works, the sequence (actually, both of them, the
one that's explicit on the command line, from the search popup, and the
one that comes from .mh_profile) do get created.

kre

ps: this is still using the version of the code form a day ago, I haven't
been able to reach the cvs repository today (local routing issue I think).

Note how at the bottom or this example bar/shoe still points to 
../snuffle/shoe/.  When you try to ""cp -axv / /some/new/root"" the 
same thing will happen.   In /usr/bin all the symlinks to

Just a side note about java/java plugin download from Oracle/Sun site.

Last time I had to install it in that way on a linux system I needed to 
make a symlink for the plugin to work in Firefox, as described in the 
Installation Guide (""Enable and Configure"" section):

http://www.java.com/en/download/help/linux_install.xml#enable

But nowadays, the proper way for setting this should be using ""update-
alternatives"" as you mentioned above. 

What is the output of ""update-alternatives --display firefox-
javaplugin.so"" command?

Mine shows:

stt008:~# update-alternatives --display firefox-javaplugin.so
firefox-javaplugin.so - el estado es auto.
 el enlace apunta actualmente a /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/amd64/
libnpjp2.so
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so - prioridad 63

Even if there is a measurable difference in image brightness or sharpness,
it's a moot point for me.  If I can't download files or reply to e-mails,
the Squeeze version is useless to me.  I'll check things out again once
the Sid version migrates to Squeeze.

Although this generally works it is not correct:

mplayer works with dga (if i am root) and works with x11

now it gives black screen window and play the music of the movie.

Please, let me know what KDE 4 is missing for you. KDE 4.4 has only a
handful of regressions from KDE 3.5.10, and they are not dealbreakers.
Some of those are addressed in KDE 4.5.

The ""KDE 4 sux"" time has passed. If you still have problems with KDE
4, then please let me know what they are so that they can be fixed.

Thanks!

Date: Not supplied

Test your knowledge with this set of movie quotes. I'll be back in a couple of 
days with the answers.


-  Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away? 

-  Any fool can get into college. Only a select few can say the same about 
Amanda Jones.

-  My dear, since Eve picked the apple, no woman has ever been taken entirely 
unawares.

-  This is Tommy. He tells people he's named after a gun, but I know he's named 
after a famous 19th century ballerina.

-  When one woman strikes at the heart of another she seldom misses, and the 
wound is invariably fatal.

-  I've never been alone with a man before, even with my dress on. With my 
dress off, it's _most_ unusual.

-  You're nothing to me now. You're not a brother, you're not a friend. I don't 
want to know you or what you do. I don't want to see you at the hotels, I don't 
want you near my house. When you see our mother, I want to know a day in 
advance, so I won't be there.

-  Kids: 10 seconds of joy, 30 years of misery.

-  Sucking all the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone.

-  A hundred million terrorists in the world and I gotta kill one with feet 
smaller than my sister.

-  Mother, I do not need a blind date. Particularly not with some verbally 
incontinent spinster who drinks like a fish, smokes like a chimney and dresses 
like her mother.

-  Have you ever seen a body like this before in your life?
She happens to be my daughter.
Oh. Then I guess you have.

-  I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is.

-  Of course, you won't be able to lie on your back for a while but then you 
can lie from any position, can't you?

-  The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that 
it was going to happen.

-  Women need a reason for having sex. Men just need a place.

-  You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are 
the same decaying organic matter as everything else.

-  Looks like I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue! 

-  The issue is not whether you are paranoid. Look around you Lenny. The issue 
is whether you are paranoid enough.

-  Inconceivable!
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. 

Enjoy."

1808,"Re: bad focus/click behavioursIt's all here in these 10 lines, otherwise known as the
""I'll try my damnest to paste something"" procedure:

# Return the current selection (from any window) or cut buffer 0.
proc Text_Selection {} {
    if [catch {selection get} sel] {
        if [catch {selection get -selection CLIPBOARD} sel] {
            if [catch {cutbuffer get 0} sel] {
                return """"
            }
        }
    }
    return $sel
}

This is in textSelection.tcl, and is what exmh uses to find text to paste.
It is that last ""cutbuffer get"" that is wacky, because exmh sticks its
own deletions into that little know stash, and is probably the only
application on the planet that still looks there.  We should probably
just disable that - try this variant:

proc Text_Selection {} {
    if [catch {selection get} sel] {
        if [catch {selection get -selection CLIPBOARD} sel] {
            return """"
        }
    }
    return $sel
}

Everything funnels through here, so you just need to hack this one spot.

1494,"[ILUG] From the desk of : George OsawaNIGERIA ELECTIRC POWER AUTHORITY 
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT 
IKOYI-LAGOS.

FROM THE DESK OF:George Osawa
I am the Chairman Contract Review Committee of National 

Electric Power Authority (NEPA). 
Although this 
proposal might come to you as a surprise since it is 

coming from someone you do not know 
or ever seen
before, but after due deliberations with my colleagues, I 

decided to contact you based on 
Intuition. 

We are soliciting for your humble and confidential 

assistance to take custody of Seventy-
One Million,
Five Hundred Thousand United States 

Dollars.{US$71,500,000.00}. This sum 
(US$71.5M) is an over 
invoice contract sum which is currently in an offshore 

payment account of the Central Bank 
of Nigeria as an 
unclaimed contract entitlement which can easily be 

withdrawn or drafted or pay to any 
recommended 
beneficiary by my committee.

On this note, you will be presented as a contractor to 

NEPA who has executed a contract 
to a tune of the
above sum and has not been paid. 
Proposed Sharing Partern (%): 

1. 70% for me and my colleagues. 

2. 20% for you as a partner/fronting for us.

3. 10% for expenses that may be incurred by both parties 

during the cause of this 
transacton.

Our law prohibits a civil servant from operating a 

foreign account, hence we are contacting 
you. If this
proposal satisfies you, do respon as soon as possible 

with the following information: 

1. The name you wish to use as the beneficiary of the 

fund. 

2. Your Confidential Phone and Fax Numbers. 

Further discussion will be centered on how the fund shall 

be transfer and full details on how 
to accomplish this 
great opportunity of ours.

Thank you and God bless. 

Best regards, 
George Osawa

75,"Automated Installation - Copy files from CD?Greetings all-

I need to modify a product based on Debian. It installs from a CD and uses the Debian installer system. Since this product does not contain the proper driver for some of my hardware, I need a way to have the installer copy some files from the CD (which I'll add to the master ISO) to the appropriate locations on the installation target. I've been through the preseed documentation and cannot seem to find it there.

Any tips/pointers/etc?

Thanks!

Not always.  Apt depends on the dependency graph being consistent, other 
than perhaps containing a cycle or two.  If the Debian maintainers slip 
up and screw up the dependencies (or the user is switching back and 
forth between distributions, say among stable, testing, and unstable), 
apt can get confused.  It has happened to me several times.  In such 
cases, using aptitude sometimes helps.  I have also resorted to 
installing by hand, though this may not have been strictly necessary.

MAA

There's also an 'objdump' program, and 'biew' hex viewer/disassembler. A good 
starting point to search is http://www.freshmeat.net/

However, cracking and reverse engineering tools are not so ubiquitous on UNIX as 
they are on Windows platform for two main reasons:

1. The main customers of commercial Unices (Solaris, HP-UX, Aix, SCO...) are 
respectable companies. They are ready to pay big bucks for software they need: the reputation matters.

2. Most software for free and open source Unices like Linux and xBSD (this 
software often may be used on commercial unices as well) is, well, free and 
open source.

NB: This is my best recollection; I'm not looking this up right now.  Pleas=
e=20
check my facts, I'd love to know if I'm wrong.

Some of that reiserfs performance came from directories-as-hash-tables, whi=
ch=20
I believe ext3/4 supports and is native for btrfs.  Some of that also came=
=20
from tail-packing, which could come from the extents feature of ext4 and=20
should be in btrfs.  The final edge reiserfs had was above-average=20
flushing/caching algorithms, and the development pushes in ext4 and btrfs h=
ave=20
likely reduced or eliminated that; I think the unified block-device caching=
=20
system in the kernel able helped make that not such a big deal.

Not really.  Reiserfs will probably be maintained in the kernel for a very=
=20
long time, in that as any interfaces it uses are updated it will be updated=
 to=20
use the new interface.  However, ISTR there are open bugs on reiserfs that=
=20
will not be fixed.  Similarly, I expect new bugs that can be blamed on the=
=20
reiserfs code are less likely to be fixed than bugs than can be blamed on t=
he=20
ext2/3/4 or xfs code.

In addition, as file system technology advances, reiserfs will become less=
=20
attractive for new installs and it will become more attractive to migrate a=
way=20
from it.  Unfortunately, migration tools are unlikely to be developed, outs=
ide=20
of generic file system migration tools.  Compare with btrfs_convert which=20
allows an ext2/3 file system to be converted to btrfs with no data copying;=
=20
such tools have to be aware of the internal structure of the file system an=
d=20
fewer and fewer developers will even HAVE that knowledge of reiserfs.  The=
=20
source will be available, sure, but even kernel maintainers interested in f=
ile=20
systems are not interested in reiserfs.

There's no drop-dead date for reiserfs in the kernel (AFAIK), so there's no=
=20
pressing need to migrate away from it, but there is a lot of work on file=20
systems that should both perform better and be supported better than reiser=
fs.

There is nothing related to Debian, only to the Desktop in use. 
The latest Knoppix (6.0) use LXDE for the desktop. If this is your version, 
aqd your Desktop, have a look at the LXDE documentation on 
http://www.lxde.org/
You could also ask for help on the LXDE forum (same url as above).

I don't know if there's a sendmail-ish way (it's not in the -d0.1 output),
but this should work:

$ strings `which sendmail` | grep -i milter

If you get a long list of function/message looking phrases, milter
is built-in.  If you get something like:

Greetings! 

You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time mailing, so no removal is necessary. 

If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that has ever landed in your Inbox. 

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE 

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit of the ""MLM Dream"" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people. 

The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM. 

HERE'S GOOD NEWS 

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income you've dreamed about is easier than you think! 

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of this before. 

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the information. Period. 

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type ""Send Info"" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox. 

Cordially, 

Majee

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And it's FREE!"

That's a good point.  That's another thing he can try: erasing or renaming

As a new user of SA, I guess I'm having trouble connecting the dots.  If 
I understand you:  If I don't use the ""nomime"" => 1 option and I recieve 
MIME mail, the Mail::Internet modules become unavailable.

Unavailable for which?  MA?  SA?  What do these methods do?  Does this 
mean my incoming MIME mail won't be checked by SA unless I specify 
""nomime"" => 1?

DataPower delivers XML acceleration device
ByScott Tyler Shafer
August 27, 2002 5:46 am PT

DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed 
specifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that 
process XML data in software, DataPower's device processes the data in 
hardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, 
according to company officials.

The new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a 
family of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The 
DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology 
called XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML 
data.

According to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was 
conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future 
proliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two 
businesses.

""Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,"" Kelly said. 
""The XA35 is the first of a family.""

Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up 
to 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on 
application servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best 
alternative.

In addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount 
importance in the world of XML.

""Today's firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,"" Kelly 
said. ""A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. 
Firewalls are blind to XML today.""

Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on 
security, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.

According to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML 
processing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company 
itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed 
and security. After trying the software path, the company turned to 
creating a solution that would process XML in hardware.

""Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,"" said Kelly, 
adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. Kelly 
said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with 
technologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes 
will be mostly false.
Other content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) 
accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, 
while the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes 
and thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.

The 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of 
XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language 
as they pass through the device.

The XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load 
balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify 
and process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.

In addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application 
co-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular 
control over what data is inspected and the application server itself 
controls the device.

DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup 
Sarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in 
May, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a 
focus on content processing and acceleration.
The DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The 
company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in 
field trails at a number of other enterprises.

=========================================================================

DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was 
founded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who 
foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols 
would have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML 
grew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and 
designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique 
requirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software 
interpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing 
is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.

Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from 
developing software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov's team raised the bar 
and designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In 
2001, DataPower's effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3), the 
industry's fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.

Today, XG3 technology powers the industry's first wire-speed XML 
network devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web 
Services. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of 
products, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, 
providing an immediate return on technology investments to 
industry-leading customers and partners.

DataPower's M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that 
brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, 
drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including 
Akamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.

DataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding

Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer 
in XML-Aware Networking for Web Services

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the 
leading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced 
that it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing. Investors for 
this round include Venrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed 
Capital Partners. Michael Tyrrell, of Venrock, Bill Burnham, of Mobius, 
and Jeff Fagnan, of Seed Capital, have joined DataPowers Board of 
Directors.

DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and 
sales of the companys breakthrough technology for XML-Aware networking. 
Founded in 1999, DataPower invented the worlds first intelligent XML 
networkingdevices, capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions 
at the wire-speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services 
and other XML-centric initiatives. DataPowers solutions are based on 
its patent-pending XML Generation Three (XG3) technology.

""Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter-and 
intra-company communications but their network infrastructure is ill 
prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. 
DataPowers XML-acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of 
XML that is required to support next generation enterprise 
applications,"" said Eugene Kuznetsov, CTO and founder of DataPower 
Technology.

""DataPower gives companies the ability to use XML thats critical to Web 
services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" A single 
DataPower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 
serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with XML 
processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. In 
addition, the DataPower platform provides enhanced XML security, 
protection against XML-based denial-of-service attacks, connection of 
e-business protocols for incompatible XML data streams, load balancing 
between back-end servers and real-time statistics reports.

""In the post-bubble economy, technology investment decisions require 
laser-focused scrutiny. DataPowers patent-pending technology addresses 
a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said Michael 
Tyrrell of Venrock Associates. ""By turbo-charging their networks with 
DataPowers unique XML-Aware networking technology, companies will be 
free to adopt next generation Web services without encountering 
performance and security pitfalls.""

""We looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly 
growing problems surrounding XML message processing performance and 
security,"" said Bill Burnham of Mobius Venture Capital. ""DataPower is on 
their third generation of technology. Their patent pending XML 
Generation Three (XG3)technology was quite simply the single most 
compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""

""XML is not a nice-to-have, it is a must have for enterprises serious 
about optimizing application efficiency. Since 1999, DataPower has been 
developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of XML and Web 
services,"" said Jeff Fagnan of Seed Capital Partners. ""DataPowers 
XML-acceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely 
on XML for mission critical applications.""

CVE Ids        : CVE-2009-3700, CVE-2009-3826
Debian Bug     : 553319

It was discovered that in squidguard, a URL redirector/filter/ACL plugin
for squid, several problems in src/sgLog.c and src/sgDiv.c allow remote
users to either:

  * cause a denial of service, by requesting long URLs containing many
    slashes; this forces the daemon into emergency mode, where it does
    not process requests anymore.

  * bypass rules by requesting URLs whose length is close to predefined
    buffer limits, in this case 2048 for squidguard and 4096 or 8192 for
    squid (depending on its version).

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-8.4+lenny1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-9.

We recommend that you upgrade your squidguard package.

Thank you Hugo, I managed to compile the proprietary driver.
Now every ctrl+alt+Fn leads to a complete black screen, with no prompt 
or cursor or anything.
Ctrl+alt+F7 works as expected.
Could it be that my system stopped creating the consoles at boot time ?
What should I check and where ?

TIA,
Jean-Marc

I don't know a lot about ALSA, but use custom kernels for many of the 
machines -- would this mean, in order to get mplayer (eg) to work, I'd 
first have to compile a custom kernel option? or kernel module? Since I 
wouldn't have your alsa-kernel(??) installed, would that mean alsa-libs 
and so on won't install?

No, the 7.3 dvdrtools works with DVD-R and DVD-RW, this package works
with DVD+R and DVD+RW. (Confused yet?) Unfortuantely these tools don't
have a gui frontend, but since the workhorse is a wrapper for mkisofs,
that shouldn't be too hard for someone who knows how to do those things.

Well that was an image I put together of just the first three disks of
the distro. Make it bootable too. Fun, but slower than a network
install.

These are the options I used:
1. In some cases, resizing the frame solved the issue.
2. In few cases, changed the location of one of the component present inside 
the frame and then relocating the same component to its original position at 
the end of the method solved the problem.
3. In one case, removed the component and added the same component to the

Another typical point to note is, I could not find a single common solution

The kernel from lenny-backports, testing, or sid will probably be using the=

Likely it is not using UUIDs trying to be compatible with initramfs-es or=20
other systems that don't like them.  But, as you've seen, using the ""raw""=20
device name doesn't really help either.  Different kernel versions, and eve=

the devices.  In odd setups, the device name might change from boot to boot=

BROTHER, CAN YOU SPARE A JET?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Creditors and shareholders of U.S. Airways found themselves in
the upright and locked position Sunday as the nation's
sixth-largest airline filed for bankruptcy protection.

The Arlington, Va.-based carrier sought cover under the
bankruptcy code's Chapter 11, but much of its trouble could be
traced to Sept. 11. Remember when all U.S. airports reopened
except for Reagan Washington, which was too close to the White
House and other gov sites? Remember how it was weeks before the
first lonely flights lifted at last? Guess which airline was the 
major carrier there. (Hint: It's the same one that bled $2
billion in the past year.)

Even before the terror attacks, U.S. Airways was an animal in
pain. To all the usual industry troubles, add these: fierce
competition from discounters, a too-small area of service
concentrated on the East Coast, and an unofficial battle with
United Airlines for the highest labor costs in the business.
Frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years
ago, reminded the Washington Post. In a bid to get bought by
United, U.S. Airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators
that it was too small to survive on 
its own. The feds disagreed and blocked the deal.

Now, of course, U.S. Airways has a new flight plan. Among those
likely to get airsick: shareholders, whose investment has
vanished; employees, many of whom are expected to lose their
jobs, even though their unions have conceded hundreds of
millions of dollars in pay; and creditors, especially
plane-leasing companies, which will collect only as much as a
bankruptcy judge approves. (Where, by the way, is the reporter
who will pick up the story of these leasing companies? Not one
creditor was named in any account we could find. Yet before we
soak our hankies over U.S. Airways, we'd like to hear a word
from the folks getting stiffed.)

Need a silver lining? Check out the Wall Street Journal, which
observes that Continental Airlines ""soared to profitability""
thanks to its time in rehab a decade ago. We're guessing that
anecdote is on the minds of Texas Pacific Group, which is
plunking down $200 million for two-fifths of U.S. Airways. Texas 
Pacific also played friend in need to Continental -- and
pocketed 11 times its investment.

Meanwhile, it will be ""business as usual"" for U.S. Airways
customers, the company's chief assured a skeptical New York
Times. The airline will even continue to track and to honor
frequent-flier miles. Better still: Cautious customers can use
U.S. Airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner,
United. And, hey, according to an analyst quoted in the Journal, 
there's at least a 20% chance that United won't be the next
major carrier to announce it's gone broke. - Lori Patel

REMEMBER GLOBAL CROSSING?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Follow-up has never been the media's strong suit. Once stories
fade from page one, so does reporters' interest. And in this
summer of corporate scandals, remembering back to Global
Crossing's January implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to 
recall the fuss over chads.

The Financial Times pegged the company's bankruptcy sale Friday
a ""long-awaited"" transaction, but few other outlets seemed to be 
holding their breath. The dearth of coverage is too bad, because 
the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention,
especially with Enron and WorldCom following behind it in the
Chapter 11 aisle. Bankruptcy, it seems, means never having to
say you're sorry. Global Crossing owed $12 billion when it filed 
for bankruptcy in January. Its sale price? $250 million -- and
that's for only a nearly two-thirds stake. Sound too low? Back
in January, Global Crossing could have gotten much more, three
times that much, and from the very same investment team, Asian
conglomerates Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies
Telemedia. But Global Crossing sniffed it was worth way more. 

Now that it has discovered it's worth way less, here's how the
deal carves up what's left of Global Crossing's pie, pending the 
regulatory approval that's expected in about six months. The two 
investors get a 61.5% stake; bank creditors get 6%, and
bondholders get about a one-third share. Who's missing from the
slice-and-dice? Shareholders, of course, who get nothing. The
company is unapologetic, and creditors feel lucky for the
crumbs. ""The reality is we could have done considerably worse,""
the Wall Street Journal quoted Edward Weisenfelder, a lawyer for 
the creditors. As for the shrewd buyers, the Financial Times
quoted Hutchison's official statement that the deal would extend 
its telecom capabilities, particularly in its broadband service. 
But the Wall Street Journal speculated that the company is
simply buying low so it can sell higher. 

Global Crossing's turned-down offer of $750 million is
approximately the same amount the company's founder, Gary
Winnick, reaped in personal riches from the sale of his stock,
as the Journal noted in its page-one story on the telecom
bandits. That's a lot of paper bits on any floor. - Deborah

If you write your script portably it will work with /bin/sh, for many
values of sh. If you rely on features of ksh or bash you should specify
one of those shells on the #! line.

""set"" works for ksh, bash, and dash. On (at least) Solaris 9 & 10 and
Debian. Is that enough?

699,"Still looking for a house?My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.

I need those houses...

Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) 

I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not.

I'm not sure what you mean. What is an ""extra"" iso?

You mean the full set of CD or DVD images? I find a net install works best 
nowadays. Then you just download and install packages as you want to.

The archive is simply huge now so it's a lot to download and burn unless you 
have machines that are not connected to the net that you want to install or

409,"[SAtalk] OT: DNS MX Record Clarification Please
This may be a little off topic but thought people here would have a better
response to this elsewhere.

I have setup two MX records (mail and bmail) for my mail server. The one I
gave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail).

bmail(10) I gave a 10 because I want all mail to go through this server to
be scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail(20) server for
delivery.

As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load
balancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10
before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available.

But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to
believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10
never goes down. Why? Have I got something confused here?

Thanks,

In which world are we talking about?  That may be true for the first sale, 
but once something is out in the world, the ""creator"" loses control... If I 
buy a chair you built, and then decide to give it away to my neighbor, by 
you're definition, he just stole from you.

Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away is a 
perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  In many places, it's 
called ""advertising"": ""buy one, get one free"", ""free shipping on any order 
over $25"", ""buy this couch, and get a coffee table for free"", ""free popcorn 
with any movie rental"", ""free doorprize to the first 100 people who enter"", 
""the author will be signing books (for free) at such and such bookstore"".

Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  Just because you 
(and the entertainment industry, it seems) can't be creative enough to come 
up with a business model to leverage free stuff into paid stuff... don't 
take it out on the rest of us.

Another thing you could consider: run testing/unstable in a virtual

unstable the upload of major packages can be delayed.

Have you asked other KDE contributors about their setups?

Sony makes such a line of products.

My father was legendary for his abilty to break things.  His 'thumbs of death'
would rival anything a toddler could do to devices.  After countless numbers of
Walkman devices having their lids broken or buttons pressed into oblivion I
found the Sony devices.  I got him a ""My First Sony"" (be afraid of the
marketing) CD player.   It was /fire engine red/ but was completely
indestructible.  I hacked a headphone jack into it and gave it to him.  He
complained of it's looks but used it nonetheless.  I also gave him a pack of
headphones as there's no such things indestuctible headphones that aren't
obscenely bulky.

Now that we're riding up the curve of an ever increasing geezer population, how
soon before device makers get wise?  Not to be morbid, but would the marketing
be ""My Last Sony""?

If xfsprogs is installed, then I think fsck will do it, just first run 
something like:

tune2fs -C912 /dev/sda3

and reboot, where C is the Capital 'C', 912 is some number larger than 
the current maximum mount count (before automatically fsck'ing) and 
substitute your actual device path for the /dev/sda3 I used as an 
example.

I think xfsprogs has some other tools as well.

Oh wait, I reread your question.


If the machine is in working order, you can just do:

#apt-get install xfsprogs

If not, then a live CD will be needed, something like Knoppix, be sure 
it has XFS support.  Just boot the live CD or DVD, and Bob's your uncle.

I'm unsure, does the Debian squeeze installer fully support XFS?

The situation between Flash and Java isn't even comparable.

Java is open and useful, Flash is neither.

Java still shares the the lowest-common-denominator cross-platform =
weakness/strength (depending on perspective), which Apple may not want =
to promote on the iPhone, because, let's face it, there are so many =
patents on the iPhone that lots of that stuff can't be done in a =
cross-platform way, because other platforms won't be allowed to have the =
same functionality.
So cross-platform code on the iPhone/iPod/iPad just doesn't make sense. =
The market is big enough that if their product sell on these devices, =
the developers can afford to make a first-class citizen native app =
rather than being lazy and trying to write the same things for =
deployment everywhere.

Nothing stops anyone from using a portable code engine (e.g. C code or =
Java compiled to C) and then put a native Cocoa Touch GUI on it.

Flash from the get-go was designed to captivate a part of the internet =
and make it privately owned, just like Silverlight and a slew of other =
efforts, too. Flash and Frames are the bane of the web. Can't properly =
search, bookmark, print, copy&paste, etc. any of these. May they die a =
quick, painful death, they caused enough suffering for users and web =
developers alike.

Having a several dozen web pages open sucks the life out of the fastest =
machines, because of all the flash. That I only could suspect until 10.6 =
put plug-ins in subprocesses. The relative CPU load between all of =
Safari vs. the Flash plug-in speaks volumes.

As much as I have to criticize about the closed nature/censorship of the =
AppStore ecosystem, I'm THRILLED that Apple isn't bending. I hope Apple =
can give the blow of death to Flash, which has been more than an =
annoyance for many years. I can't wait until that's a chapter in =
computing HISTORY. Bravo Jobs&Co.!!!

I also support his statement about Adobe being lazy. No version of any =
Macromedia/Adobe Suite has ever run properly on any machine that has a =
case-sensitvive root file system. If software is properly written, it =
shouldn't even notice a difference, and the only parties which have to =
be aware of the difference are users that copy files in a mixed file =
system environment, or writers of backup/file-management software (where =
2 files on one file system might map to one file on another).

Only sloppy coding where paths are not #define-ed in one place but more =
or less accurately copy&paste-ed all over the code base causes issues =
with resource and path name mismatches when the software is installed on =
a case-sensitive file system. For a decade and several product cycles =
Adobe didn't fix that, even though there were many bug reports about the =
matter and even though Apple emphasized several times on various =
occasions at WWDC that developers shouldn't make any assumptions on the =
nature of the file system that the system is installed.

Adobe didn't (want to) get it. They just wanted to continue milking =
their old pre-OS9 code base for as long as possible. I wish Apple would =
use some of their war chest to produce true competitors to Adobe's crap =
that are reasonably priced. Adobe charges up the wazoo, and didn't care =
to be a good platform citizen, and were it not for the 64-bit =
transition, they'd still ship old, buggy Carbon based code. Barf! I'm =
glad Jobs finally said it and broke with corporate politeness.=

    From:        Brent Welch 
    Message-ID:  

  | I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in

I actually think you're looking in the wrong place.   I, at least,
have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or
selected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,
which appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.

The problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)
where it shouldn't - the previous selection should only be cleared
when there's something else to replace it (even if the highlighting
of what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom
application (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There
normally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary
selection (that is, set it to be a null string).

Then, because of the ""if I get asked for the selection value, I will
find something"" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert
point, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because the
PRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing
else has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from
either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was
deleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.

That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.

Once that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal
""select stuff, click at new insert point, paste"" mode of operation
that almost everyone expects to work (whether the ""select stuff""
is somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).

kre

ps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I've never
really understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that
part of the code and see how it all really operates.

You only need to edit /etc/default/grub and run update-grub in order
to modify /boot/grub/grub.cfg (theoretically; unfortunately, you have
to edit /etc/grub.d/10_linux or /etc/grub.d/30_os-prober to change the
default generation of the menu entry names or prevent os-prober from
picking up a windows recovery partition),

The squeeze and sid kernels set the graphic mode through Kernel-based
Mode Setting (KMS). I only use headless and Xless boxes so I have not
looked into whether the kernel uses grub2's GRUB_GFXMODE OR
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX variables to set the video mode. KMS can be
turned off in grub.cfg with either ""nomodeset"" (possibly superceded)
or "".modeset=0"" where video=i915|i945|nouveau|radeon... but I
have only gleaned this from reading Fedora and Ubuntu stuff.

What about the carrot approach?  Find an even better 
backup method, compatible with Grub 2 and appealing 
to your management for its efficiency.

Or what about putting Grub on a USB flash which can 
be replicated easily and is largely independent of 
your main non-volatile storage.  The flash fails 
and you plug in another.  Main storage fails and 
you invoke the traditional backup.

I think I'm going to become one of _those_ people. You know, one of those 
people who has a &#8220;Semantic Web&#8221; category on their weblog. This will 
be a Geek Purity Test question someday. Onward: 

- _Phil Ringnalda_: Fun with RDF[1]. &#8220;RDF can actually be fun, as long as 
you don't foolishly invest too much ego in trying to store RSS 1.0, or wander 
off into flame wars.&#8221; From which we find: 
- _Shelley Powers_: The RDF Query-O-Matic[2], and The RDF Query-O-Matic 
explained[3]. &#8220;The Query-o-Matic accepts the name of an RDF file (any 
valid RDF file), and an RDFQL (RDF Query Language) query, and will print out a 
test value found as a result of that query.&#8221; 
- _Marcus Campbell_: &#8220;My FOAF autocreation script is moving along nicely
[4]. It's now looping through my OPML blogroll file, checking the first load of 
bites in people's pages for head linked FOAF files, grabbing certain elements 
from these files (if they have one) and spitting them out into a brand new FOAF 
file for me.&#8221; 
- _Joe Gregorio_: The Well-Formed Web[5]. &#8220;After spending some time 
badgering poor Bill Kearney for a concrete benefit of having RDF in RSS 1.0 and 
not getting a really satisfactory answer I went back and read Paul Ford's essay 
again. I wanted to get that old religious feeling back again. It didn't work. 
The magic was gone.&#8221;

So how much of it is due to jumping the inter-species boundary for 
STATUS - i.e. I can fuck any of several
reasonable candidates from my own species, or I can  be ambitious, and 
go after the authority figure in the room.
The alternative hypothesis is that its due to novelty, and then of

appropriate conditions."" Hmmm, is this a potential intelligence test, 
seeing as the last is a particularily human response?

Max number of files 	Variable, allocated at creation time[1]

[1] The maximum number of inodes (and hence the maximum number of files 
and directories) is set when the file system is created. If V is the 
volume size in bytes, then the default number of inodes is given by V/213 
(or the number of blocks, whichever is less), and the minimum by V/223. 
The default was deemed sufficient for most applications. The max number

ignores or misuses those web standards on its corporate site, you have to 
wonder who didn't get the memo.&#8221; 

The new design also fails even the most basic accessibility tests[2]; the home 
page contains 80 instances of images without ALT text. This is the same basic 
failing for which the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games was 
successfully sued in 2000[3]. 

Here is what microsoft.com looks like in a text-only browser[4]. (To better 
understand the experience, take a piece of paper and cover your entire monitor 
except for the top line, then scroll the window slowly so you can only read one 
line at a time.) While nothing is technically locked out (all the links are 
regular links, nothing requires Javascript to function properly), all the 
un-ALT-enhanced images (which are mostly spacer images and images-as-bullets) 
add so much clutter to the page that it's very difficult to navigate. 

Meanwhile, I don't want to imagine what it would sound like through a screen

A proper RDBMS will have a hot-backup feature, so I'd still say that

My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I first
get a button that reads:
	""Check the signature with GnuPG""
If I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyring
then I get a message saying just that, and the message:
	""Can't check signature: public key not found""
along with a button with the inscription
	""Query keyserver""
If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs.  Forever.

If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself
and then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it
must be the code that goes out to the keyserver.

Anyone else with this problem?

Most inkjets on a UPS are fine (for small jobs), lasers no--too much current
draw heating up the fuser.  I've never printed during a power outage but I
could if I really needed to.  The odds of that are terribly low though.

Them main reason for plugging all my equipment into the UPS is that the MOVs
in UPSes are usually much larger and of better quality than those found in
surge protector power strips.  For those who do not know, an MOV or metal
oxide varistor, is the device that sucks up the excess voltage and current
that frequently enters lines during a lighting strike.

Yeah but I was right and I was there. The people who were saying that it
did not happen did not see the fadeout in progress. It only came back
after the server was rebooted properly. However improbable it seemed at
the time, the nameservers came back up after a power outage without the
.ie zonefile. As a result it, there was nothing in the file that the
secondaries picked up. At the time, I thought that the file was on an
NFS. But if it regenerated after reboot, and the NFS input was not
there, it would have generated a blank zonefile - that makes some sense.
History now but it has an alarming relevance. :)

Confirm that. The nameservers themselves had connectivity problems from
what I could see and it was going on for a while, even *after* the
initial SOA problems. 

I am thinking of writing a simple .ie secondary state monitor for
inclusion on WhoisIreland.com as these guys seem to be technologically
incapable of running their own DNSes. What kind of distorted logic hands
the admin of a national tld to a company that does not even handle DNS
for its own domain? Whatever selection process IEDR used should be
investigated by the relevant government department, especially as the
company supposedly providing technical administration to IEDR did not
actually spot this loss of synch. The IEDR contract with the company
should be reviewed in the light of this event. This kind of 1 week loss
of synch should not happen with a national domain. Ireland as E-hub -
more like e-jit central! :)

I had cited the information theoretic concept of ""elegance""
in my dissertation & did a Google to find the reference and instead
found a really great tech report for UoT Knoxville by Bruce
MacLennan.  He cites Efficiency, Economy, and Elegance, but
I think he's wrong.  The middle E should be Effectiveness. 
Otherwise kudos.


Efficiency is the relation of output to input effectiveness is
the total output.  In information theory, something is both elegant
and efficient if no smaller or less costly something can product the 
same output in the same amount of time.

The Value of Analogies

Programming language design is a comparatively new activity - it has existed for less than half a century, so
it is
often worthwhile to look to older design disciplines to understand better this new activity. Thus, my book
Principles of Programming Languages: Design, Evaluation, and Implementation, grew out of a study of teaching
methods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design.
Perhaps you
have also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (FORTRAN = Model T, C = dune
buggy, etc.). 

These analogies can be very informative, and can serve as ``intuition pumps'' to enhance our creativity, but
they
cannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions must
be
based on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative. 

In this essay I'll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but I will base my remarks
on a
book about structural engineering, The Tower and the Bridge, by David P. Billington. Although there are many
differences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transfer
rather
directly. 

According to Billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call
``the
three E's'': Efficiency, Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology,
which
Billington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three S's). We will consider each in
turn. 


Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used

In structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safety
and the
issues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). Similarly, in programming language
design,
efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples where
efficiency
considerations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming
Languages). In the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing
time, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized was
programmer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN's
implicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed
for the
sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking). 

Efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we
are
not comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as
programmer time. Similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are
reduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now
turn. 


Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost

Whereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. In structural engineering, economy seeks
to
maximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges
are
usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design, the ``public''
that
must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these
programmers work. 

Economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example,
the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost
of
computer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the
increasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of
program
maintenance compared to program development. 

Other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether major
manufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some
way
by influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense), whether it has been standardized, whether
it
comes to be perceived as a ``real'' language (used by ``real programmers'') or as a ``toy'' language (used by
novices
or dilettantes), and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles, social factors are
frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming
language. 

Often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are
often
unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also, many social issues, from
dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately
represented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost'' and ``benefit'' must be considered
in
seeking an economical design. 


Elegance Symbolizes Good Design

``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?'' snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but Billington shows clearly the
critical
role of elegance in ``hard-nosed'' engineering. 

For the Designer

It is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the
difficulty
of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples).
Structural
engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but Billington observes that the best designers don't
make
extensive use of computer models and calculation. 

One reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about which
variables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this
decision is not
made well. Also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this
is
another potential source of error. Because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical
analysis
may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price of
safety is
additional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy). 

Similarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a
choice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an
over-engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical. 

Many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; it
vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design.
Billington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a
consequence of
an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However, the very problem that destroyed
the
Tacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided
by aesthetic principles. 

According to Billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do
not
abandon it altogether). Rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is because
solutions to
structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible
solutions to a
particular problem, such as bridging a particular river. Therefore, expert designers restrict their attention
to
designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces are
unbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable. 

The general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can
be
guided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this idea
by
inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. He adds
(p.
21), ``When the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.'' In other words, the choice of
form is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and
economical design). If we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design. 

The same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which the
interaction
of features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let our
aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having
to
check all the possible interactions. 

For the User

In this case, what's good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge
that
looks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which
features may ``explode'' if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well-designed
bridge
gives us confidence when we cross it. So also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should
reinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in the
consequences
of our actions. 

We accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable to
sustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won't much matter that it was beautiful on the
outside.
So also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation
of a
deep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their
(unwarranted)
confidence. 

In summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As a
consequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or
programming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited
value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize the
preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages: 
                                The Elegance Principle

              Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good. 



The Programming Language as Work Environment

There are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programming
language is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortable
and
safe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that
take
place within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop? 

A programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer's
fatigue
and frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator,
encouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines'' and work as a
natural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine'' by encouraging
the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programming
language should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs. 

Through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example, in the variety of
its features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may
represent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programming
language can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; by
neglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention.
Out of
sight, out of mind. 


Acquiring a Sense of Elegance

Aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined
sense
of elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive
experience
in design, which, especially in Europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers.
Because of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each
competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The public
also
critiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along
with that of the designers. 

So also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively -
and criticize, revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people's designs
and try
to improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing''
comes
along.

THE MISSING LINK | Scot has cyber tomb with a view

Sometimes an epitaph just can't be the last word. Billy Kemp was a
great Scot who died a couple of years ago at the young age of 52. He
was a councilman, husband, father and pillar of his community. His
family couldn't possibly post all that on a tombstone. But they did
manage to fit http://www.billykemp.org.uk/ on there. Yep, Kemp's
tombstone doubles as a billboard for his Web site, created
posthumously by his son as a tribute to his father's life. The grave
site has gotten more than 33,000 hits, perhaps more visits than the
gravesite!

Can you clarify?  Listing all the functions in the current shell environment
solves my issue perfectly.. But less is just a pager, no?  Oh, wait, did you
mean ""much less list""?   In which case, we're in the same boat, but I'm
hoping there is a solution I'm not aware of (even though my hopes are dim :)

That would work pretty much everywhere except bone-stock Solaris, where I
have no possibility of recovery -- ""/bin/bash: bad interpreter: No such file
or directory"".  At least if I use /bin/sh as my interpreter, I can always at
the very least output an error message.

I suppose my other alternative is roughly  [ -x /bin/bash ] && /bin/bash $0
$* && exit $?, and assume that everywhere-but-solaris has /bin/bash. Hmm.
If debian keeps bash around as a default package, even when dash-is-bin-sh,
then I guess I'm in fairly safe territory in that regard.

Thanks,
Wes

Irish is taught badly in schools. But then again so is French. I did 3 years
of French in primary school and 6 in secondary school. So, that's 9 years of
French. Which, I guess, should be long enough to be fluent in most languages.
As it turns out, my French is crap. My Irish is much better. 

The problem seems to be the braindead attempt to make people learn languages
they can't speak through reading and writing. And then tacking on speech as
an afterthought. Whereas doing it the other way round would be a lot more
useful...

I hear this complaint a lot, but I never hear people complaining about being
""forced"" to learn to read and write, or to do maths. Maybe people don't mind
as much if it is perceived as a useful skill (which Irish is not usually
perceived as).

Anyway, tir gan teanga tir gan anam :)

Hi there,

I recently delved into how the linux system clock and the hardware clock
interact with each other when I set up ntp on my system while connected
to the net. However, I didn't realise that Windows altered the hw clock
as there was no mention of it in any of the docs I read. 
I still dual-boot on a regular basis and if Windows is sneakily messing
with the clock, I'd be interested to know in what way it is and how it
couild be stopped from doing so. Everything seems to work fine since I
set the system up but I still don't like to have these gaps in my
knowledge.

Regards,
Anthony Geoghegan

216,"Brightness OSD in SqueezeHi,

I am running up-to-date squeeze on a Dell Latitude D420. I have a
trivial problem, but such things bother me :-)

The hotkeys for volume and brightness adjustment work out of the box in a
GNOME session. However, when I adjust the volume using the hotkeys, I see
a nice translucent on-screen display of the volume level. This is not
the case for brightness control.

Interestingly, I briefly installed KDE a couple of days ago. I then
found that, *during a GNOME session*, the brightness OSD did appear. It
vanished again after I removed KDE.

So, the KDE installation seemed to pull in some package which is
responsible for the brightness OSD. Any idea which of the dozens of
packages it might be?

I wouldn't make that assumption.  I'd assume that rewrite_subject was on,

not everyone knows to go look in the user_prefs file to make those

Triying with dragonplayer it also fails with xine backend, amarok and
kaffeine on the other hand play it complete.

Switched to gstreamer backend and DragonPlayer played it successfully.

I think you may have to file two separate bugreports: one to k3b
suggesting as a new feature to use ogg files instead of wavs; and a
separate to phonon indicating to xine backend fails to play k3b's
files.

But since it does play ok with amarok (which also uses phonon)
probably will be nice to ask this question to a phonon developer,
maybe that the issue is in k3b and dragonplayer.

Cheers,
Ismael

Possibly.  I checked in a change to classifier.py overnight (getting rid of

tokenization.

> Is it safe to conclude that avoiding any cleverness with headers is a
> good thing?

Since I don't know what you did, exactly, I can't guess.  What you seemed to
show is that you did *something* clever with headers and that doing so
helped (the ""after"" numbers are better than the ""before"" numbers, right?).
Assuming that what you did was override what's now
tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers with some other routine, and didn't
call the base Tokenizer.tokenize_headers at all, then you're missing
carefully tested treatment of just a few header fields, but adding many
dozens of other header fields.  There's no question that adding more header
fields should help; tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers doesn't do so only
because my testing corpora are such that I can't add more headers without
getting major benefits for bogus reasons.

Apart from all that, you said you're skipping Received.  By several
accounts, that may be the most valuable of all the header fields.  I'm
(meaning tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers) skipping them too for the
reason explained above.  Offline a week or two ago, Neil Schemenauer
reported good results from this scheme:

    ip_re = re.compile(r'(\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})')

    for header in msg.get_all(""received"", ()):
        for ip in ip_re.findall(header):
            parts = ip.split(""."")
            for n in range(1, 5):
                yield 'received:' + '.'.join(parts[:n])

This makes a lot of sense to me; I just checked it in, but left it disabled
for now."

Indeed so, in this case. In the general case, it might be quicker to 
enable DHCP than to find out what network the router resets to. Usually 
192.168.0. or 192.168.1., but not always.

In the days before Internet dongles, the only Net connection available 
was usually the one on the other side of an apparently non-functional 
router, and the customer had no idea where the book/CD was.

And to be honest, I normally run XP on my laptop, and it's just ticking 
or unticking a box. Windows has moved on, no reboot necessary... I can 
remember needing the installation CD to change IP addresses on 95/98.

You can just recompile the apt source RPM, if it's the newer one. (Such
as mine). There's no dependancies on libstdc++ other than binary ones.

Currently on release dwd2, which I'm using on my home rawhide box.
(Obviously not production, since the old apt works fine on production
boxes).

Now... Does anyone know of a good way to delete ""old"" RPMS from a
directory containing both ""new"" and ""old"" RPMS? Say I have
blurb-0.1.0-1.i386.rpm, blurb-0.1.0-2.i386.rpm, and
blurb-0.1.1-1.i386.rpm, and want to remove the blurb-0.1.0-* because of
the presence of blurb-0.1.1-1? Anyone have a convenient script?

I was sufficiently intrigued by the (apparent) absence of a simple MTA
that does the above, so I decided to write my own: Tmta.  It actually
works, and is documented, although it's still pretty much in the
proof-of-concept stage:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/tmta/

One important thing that it does *not* (yet?) do is fork; it's currently
implemented as a basic, single-threaded daemon, so it can only accept
one connection at a time.  It shouldn't be too difficult (famous last
words ...) to convert into a multi-threaded model, although I have no
experience with that sort of thing.

It is still small, though - under 70 lines of actual Perl code,
although it does, of course, require the basic Perl installation and
about a half-dozen other modules.

If anyone has any feedback, or suggestions for improvement, I'd love
to hear them.

What do you mean by ""CD-Key or the like"" (I presume that ""of"" was a
typo)? And what do you mean by ""unbreakable""?

You need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish to
solve, and about the constraints involved.

Some general points:

1. For a conventional ""CD key"" system, where the actual CDs are
mass-produced (where you have many identical CDs), and the entire
system has to work offline, you cannot solve the problem of valid keys
being ""traded"" (e.g. included along with bootleg copies of the
product).

If there's an online element involved, you can ""tie"" keys to a
specific hardware configuration, as is done (AFAIK) for Windows XP's
""product activation"".

2. Anything which uses a symmetric cipher (or hash) is bound to be
vulnerable to reverse engineering of the validation routines within
the executable.

3. Ultimately, any software mechanism will be vulnerable to
""cracking"", i.e. modifying the software to disable or circumvent the
validation checks.

This can only be prevented by the use of trusted hardware (e.g. a
Palladium-style system).

Most significantly, the data must be supplied in a form which is only
accessible by that hardware. If anyone can get at the data in a
meaningful (i.e. unencrypted) form, they can extract the useful parts
and discard the rest (i.e. any associated protection mechanisms).

IOW, you have to ""keep the genie in the bottle"" at all times. If the
data can be got at just once (even if it requires the use of dedicated
hardware such as a bus analyser), it can then be duplicated and
distributed without limit.

Another config parameter.

The filter could add a header file.  Or a ~ to the subject if you like

Gack. Did you try 7.3 with the compat-glibc first? Or does it require an
antique kernel?

I'd say that the file apt downloaded is corrupted. Maybe trying ""apt-get
clean"" to remove all downloaded files first would solve the problem.

If you are using Lenny then you are stuck. Unless you compile KDE SC 4.4

Not sure if you already tested, but Thunderbird+Lightning (Icedove

BTW, I agree. I miss some of the KMail/Kontact features :-)

Also, run top(1) sorting by (M)emory.  You'll almost definitely see

There was a feature where GNOME or KDE would pre-load OOo at DE 
startup.  That way, it *appears* that OOo loads much faster, even 
though it was really just shifted.

I'm not trying to load an instance of the class, I'm trying to load the 
actual class definition.  The error is telling me that the Java 
ClassLoader can't find that class on the classpath (at least that's my 
understanding).  What I don't understand is, for it to have called the 
static initializer, that means Java has already loaded the class 
definition, right?  So why can't it find it?

1706,"RE: Java is for kiddies
Misc rants about finding jobs, java vs C, what makes a good programmer, etc.


Okay, hmm, I thought twice about this, but what the hey, jobs are hard to
come by. There's a company hiring in Mountain View, looking for a few good
hackers, no Java, no GUI, not even C++ -- just C and Linux and networking
and good old stuff like that. They just raised a wad of money and they're
looking for a few ""really good programmers"", says the CTO. I know him --
very smart guy. Drives too fast, though, for what that's worth.

Joe Bob says ""check it out"". I'd be happy to pass on your resume, or you can
send it straight to them. Probably won't matter if I pass it on, since I
don't know you guys anyway...

Thanks for the quick response.

I just got it to work another way by having QuickTime Player 7 open  
before I click the link on the web page which has the embed attribute  
of target=""quicktimeplayer"".  Quicktime 7 Player then displays the  
authorization dialog and that works correctly.

They know bull semen, and the burger you ate at lunch may have had its 
sire's contribution to its genetics purchased through them.

My ex-wife worked in their lab for a year while I was in gradual school. 
We had boxes of masking tape from ABS pre-printed with the names and 
serial numbers of 'decomissioned' bulls.

They are also known for the hideous puns on their sign just outside of 
Madison on I90/94. But the puns haven't been any good since the secretary 
who first wrote them retired.

591,"[Razor-users] Reducing impact from tons of emailI'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail
problem. Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning
FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my
wife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few other
services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we
get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On
occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a
reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in
which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see
over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an
occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.

I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated
with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,
to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor
files. So I have just added ""-home /etc/razor"" as an argument. I
haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether
this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This
paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph
above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)

At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email
processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,
perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?

Any ideas would be welcome.

Thanks,
Joe

This is a very sane advice. I also started with a stable install, but=20
after some time I decided I can handle testing. The problem is not that=20
it's hard to run testing because it breaks, it is just a bit more likely =

to break in which case it is good to have some experience sorting out=20
the debris. For unstable, this is probably even more true.

I don't understand this explanation.  I generate large image files all
the time using java.awt.headless=true.  My graphics code can't tell the
difference whether it's running on real AWT or headless AWT, it works
fine either way.  I didn't have to do anything special for this to work.
Are you sure it matters to your code?

Well, %configure doesn't define ""--program-prefix="", so that's why it
works. Maybe you thought that was an example, but no, it's the exact syntax
to use as a workaround ;-)

347,"dvd::rip on Red Hat 8.0?Hello,

Has anyone made a working source RPM for dvd::rip for Red Hat 8.0?
Matthias has a spec file on the site for 0.46, and there are a couple of
spec files lying around on the dvd::rip website, including one I patched
a while ago, but it appears that the Makefile automatically generated is
trying to install the Perl libraries into the system's, and also at the
moment dvd::rip needs to be called with PERLIO=stdio as it seems to not
work with PerlIO on RH8's Perl.

Not too sure what the cleanest way to fix this is - anyone working on
this?

Thanks,

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-43-351083,00.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TONY BLAIR's special relationship with George W. Bush is under
considerable strain. Not only do the two disagree on Yassir Arafat's
tenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started
telling disparaging anecdotes about the President.

Baroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good
friend Tony Blair' recently in Brighton. Blair, Bush and Jacques
Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of
the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in
Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'

Date: 2002-10-06T18:12:51+01:00

Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code"

Our firmware is not built to be single-parented. You can counteract that
somewhat by exposing the kid to a community of close friends, but not too
many do that.

I don't know what exactly is wrong, but something is definitely wrong.  
This is way too important to be left to just our intuition of what is

There are several issues here.

(1) For reasons that have nothing to do with
commercial advertising, we need email software that
prevents virus attacks a la Melissa and Klez. We
simply can't continue down the path where every
script kiddie with a grudge or political agenda can
cause millions or billions of dollars worth of
damage.

(2) Very likely, email practices will evolve to the
point that digital signatures are the standard way
to recognize the sender of a message. Sabotaging
your machine or otherwise compromising your private
key will be the only way that someone can forge a
message from you. I don't see any reason that email
software that automatically uses digital signatures
for contact management and whitelisting would be
any more expensive than existing email clients.
Unless Microsoft manages to get a defacto monopoly
on it.

(3) I think identity theft should be made a felony,
with very stiff penalties, for reasons that have
nothing to do with spam. No, obviously, simply
parading around with a sign that says ""I'm George
Bush"" is not identity theft. On the other hand,
I think using a virus to compromise someone else's
private key should should fall into that category.

As I demonstrated, ext3 can have 50000 files in a ""folder"" (directory).
Or as many more as the filesystem has space for.

The 31998 subdirectories limit is rarely encountered because using a
multi-level directory heirarchy is so much more efficient.

FROM: CAPT JOHN OKELE 

DEAR SIR, 

I got your contact through a Military friend who I did training with in your country, I am Captain JOHN OKELE the former Commander of the Security Guards of the late Laurent Kabila (former President, Democratic Republic of Congo (Africa), I am presently in self-exile with my wife and one child in remote Leicester City Britain, due to threat of the present Government headed by the son of Late Laurent Kabila after my life and my family to kill, saying that I know about the death of his father.


I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  

Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila. It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away. 

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance. 

I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently. 

Expecting your prompt response. Also furnish me with your current E-mail address, Tel/Fax Numbers (Private) for a personal contact with you. 

NOTE: Please you can call or fax to the line above, it belong to my cousin, as he know the confidentiality, you can reach me direct on my mail above.  

Yours Faithfully,

1336,"Epiphany browser continues to get worse and worseI am continuing to suffer the on-going de-volution of the once-decent
epiphany browser under Debian Squeeze.  First they broke file
downloading.  They still haven't fixed that.  I'll bet it's been
six months or more.

Now I can't reply to any e-mails using the Wow basic
webmail client.  I click on the ""Reply"" button, the mail compose
screen appears for a fraction of a second, then I get this error
screen.  The problem does not occur with iceweasel.  The problem is
very recent.  It broke with a recent
""aptitude update;aptitude full-upgrade"" sequence.  I suppose I could
report a bug, but I'm not about to give them my password so they
can logon as me to test it!  I'm going back to iceweasel again.
I kept using epiphany so I would know when the file download feature
got fixed.  Instead they broke something else.

1480,"Re: 2.5.0 weirdnessOK. I have since verified that sometimes I lose focus and sometimes X11 pops
to the front even when another application is runing. For example, I'm using
powerpoint, and then...gee, all my xterms. Hello, xterms. But Powerpoint
still has ""focus"" in the sense that my keypresses go to powerpoint, which is
hidden behind my xterms.

But here's the thing--this all started with 2.5.0. This bug is not present
in the Snow Leopard standard install. So perhaps there *is* something
XQuartz.app can do about it?

Do you really think this is true?  I added a modify time check thinking that 
it would make an improvement since we were reading it a *lot* more times in 
the new code because we're trying to use the sequences.

On the other hand, the sequences files are probably being read out of cache 
when that happens anyway.

Even with a small file, I'd think that the time taken to do a 
[file mtime $filename] would be worth it.  My code is in proc MhReadSeqs.

Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or

The problem is the problem you're trying to solve is never the same. Java
will soon suffer API-rot (alot of poeple are already complaining about it),
it's just new. C was clean in the beginning too. API-rot is PURELY a
function of age.

I do this all the time, It's alot easier then you think if the original
programmer had a clue at all... Java does remove the clue requirement tho,
just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren't as cheap ;)

No it's not, but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high
school. Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it's
working!

Know that feng shui always works best when it is applied in a subtle way. Do not have little
wind chimes hanging from your computer or bring bagua mirrors and three legged frogs. Find office decor-appropriate solutions to improve your space, solutions that you like and that fit into the overall office environment. Last but sure not least, if you know that your office set-up has challenging feng shui and there is not much you can do about it, make an extra effort to create good feng shui in your home, especially in your bedroom. This will assure that your personal energy is receiving the needed replenishment and support to be able to withstand hours in a questionable feng shui office environment. See what feng shui office energizers you are allowed to bring into your space and go for their best placement. Some of the feng shui must-have for the office are air-purifying plants and high energy items, such as photos that carry the energy of happy moments or bright, inspiring art with vibrant colors. If you have your back to the door, be sure to find a way to see the reflection of the entrance, meaning to have a view of what is going on behind your back. You can do that with any strategically placed office related-object made from shiny metal.

You typo'd that.  It should be:

Channel 0 : DDRII_1, DDRII_3
Channel 1 : DDRII_2, DDRII_4

I'm not sure how you come to that, but, ok..

Gigabyte has screwed up the DIMM slot color coding on the GA-M56S-S3, at
least according to the manual.  I just looked at Intel, Asus, and other
Gigabyte boards and they all follow the correct alternating color pattern.

Aioanei, you've based your entire argument on your knowledge of a single
main board.  This board was incorrectly manufactured, or the manual text is
incorrect.  Yes, manufacturers do make mistakes.  Look at the ATA_HORKAGE
blacklist sections in libata-core.c to see lists of hard drives the
manufacturers screwed up.  All of the Goliaths are in there, Hitachi,
Maxtor, Seagate, Western Digital.  They're all shipped drives that don't
meet one spec or another.  If these Goliaths can screw up, I guarantee you a
tiny company like Gigabyte can, and probably does so far more often.

Now, go look at the DIMM socket colors and layout pattern on the Intel,
Asus, and yes, other Gigabyte boards to see what the proper color coding for
dual channel memory sockets is, and look at the text descriptions of the
slot and channel numbers.  This GA board is an anomaly, and is flawed in
this regard.

Take a look at the RHS of my email address.  That's my personal domain.
They call me TheHardwareFreak for a reason. ;)

The odds against me making a factually incorrect statement here about
hardware are so high you should place a standing bet with your local bookie. :P

This is hardly a new book.  In fact, it was written in the days of Woody.
(Woody -> Sarge -> Etch -> Lenny -> Squeeze)
And parts of it are obsolete.  But the author focuses on the core stuff of
Unix/Linux, and so most of it is still current.  It's an excellent guide
for how to accomplish common computing tasks in Linux, usually with a
command line tool, and the author has a clear bent toward Debian.

   http://dsl.org/cookbook/cookbook_toc.html

This is the original version of the book, and it is free.  There's an
expanded 2nd Edition available in hard copy for a fee.

cottages and road access across a 60-metre land bridge. She didn't
divulge the price. The couple, whom she met through a mutual friend in
the area, had discussed buying the island four years ago. But she didn't
make the decision to sell until January when her family was no longer
interested in keeping their summer home, purchased in the late 1960s.
Hawke, an Oscar nominee for his role in Training Day in 2001, visited
the Tracadie area in June. He is now on tour to promote his second book,
Ash Wednesday. His first novel, Hottest State, was published in 1996.
Thurman is known for her 1994 lead roles in Even Cowgirls Get the Blues
and Pulp Fiction, for which she received an Oscar nomination.=20

British boys reserved?
Gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow
 ,
currently single and searching for love, has complained that British men
just don't play the dating game the way she's used to. The 29-year-old
actress, who has a home in London and was there to perform on stage in
Proof, says: ""British people don't seem to ask each other out on dates.
If someone asks you out they're really going out on a limb, whereas in
America, it happens all the time. It's no big deal and no weight should
be attached to it. It's only dinner, for God's sake."" Gwyneth,
previously attached to Hollywood heartthrobs Brad Pitt

and Ben Affleck
 ,
admits she was asked out a couple of times when last in London, and she
accepted with pleasure. One of her ""very charming"" dates was actor James
Purefoy
 ,
who starred in A Knight's Tale, she told a magazine. But who flew in to
really save the day? A hardy Canadian lad, that's who. Word about town
is that singer Bryan Adams recently squired Ms. Paltrow around town.

A one-on-one interview
Muscle-bound Vin Diesel
 ,
star of the current hit movie XXX, isn't shy around reporters. In fact,
he was so taken by Entertainment Tonight reporter, Maria Manounos, that
he asked her out! Menounos, 24, is a former Massachusetts Teen USA
winner. She got the chance to interview the 35-year-old Diesel in July
and when the subject of dating came up, she asked if he was ""available"".
It turns out he was and a week later the pair ran into each other again
at the premiere of XXX in Westwood, California. When he saw Maria,
according to a tabloid news report, he grabbed her hand and started
whispering in her ear. He was overhead promising to see her later in the
day.

351,"shoe horn KDE3.5 systemHi 
it sounds a bit weird but its pretty close to what I need to do.
As you can see from my footer I use mandriva and I like it.
I have however an app which does not.
It needs QT3 and KDE3.5 to run, anfd it has to be run in a KDE DM. It crashes
when run on gnome.I have made space in the middle of one of the two SATA drives.
There's about 100 GB it can use.
I have gone back on Mandriva releases and 2008.0 was the last to solely use
KDE3.5, if piklab finds a KDE4 lib it crashes, and from MDV2008.1 they merged.
MDV 2008.0 would be OK but it won't recognise SATA HDs.
I tried Ubuntu to try and load it in that 100 Gb gap, but it wanted all of the
drive, even when told use unused space.
I know Debian is stable, will the installer if told install its self on to an
unused section of the SATA HD and put its bootloader at the start of the rott
partition , ie"" /"", not /root.
Is the a version that used KDE3.5, QT3 that will work on a SATA HD, will the 32
bit versions run on a 64 bit or must I use the AMD_64 version.
Are the any problem with the kernel supplied with what ever version is
suggested with RTL8111/8168B PCI express ethernet cards, on MDV certain kernels
in 2009 had problems with the driver for that card.

A quick reply would really be appreciated, I've been trying to get this app to
run for the last couple of days without any luck.

TIA

I have my own thoughts on this, and would be very keen to create yet another
new (and different) distro.

Of course, it would require a minimum of EUR300,000 in funding, which is the
reason I have not started this project myself... :(

Last time I experimented with cron-apt it did mention that aptitude is=20
not really supported. But I don't see a problem in letting it use=20
apt-get and doing your own package management with aptitude.

Are the people who use procrustean web
forms practices the same ones who don't
accept faxes?

When I *really* need to get something
done, instead of just idle surfing, I
call or fax.  Faxing, like a web form,
can be done 24x7; it allows me to give
all the (and only the) pertinent info
in a single place; it also provides a
self-journalled correspondence, which
means rollback is easy and replay is
even easier.

I've been running a tiled (but somewhat
overlapped, yielding a horizontal stack)
window manager lately.  Like filling in
a web form, finding edges and shuffling
windows may seem productive, but I find
that having a window manager manage the
windows means I can concentrate on what
I want to do with their contents.

My girlfriend's Dell Mini's screen got cracked on a recent trip even though
we had it in a protective case and now the netbook is useless, because to
replace one of those screens basically requires taking the entire machine
apart and it's out of warranty.  My 6 year old Dell Latitude D800 on the
other hand, while weighing in about 3 times as much, is solid as a brick and
the screen has no flex.  After the Dell Mini lasted only 8 months, we've
decided no more netbooks.  But that's just our experience, I know netbooks
work well for some people.   I question their durability for using while
travelling though, which is kinda the whole point of the netbooks...

Of course, ""umount, then remove"" is the normal way to remove USB stick
(and any other storage). But as far as main idea of automounting is
""easy (un)plug"" (in my opinion at least), we have little weird but
working principle ""sync, then unplug, and udev will carry out
everything else"". As I already said, it's really weirds, but it works.

But all you said made me hard thinking about the way I mount and
unmount my removable media. Maybe I should forget about sync and use
'umount /mnt/sd[a-z]' instead, or even write little script which will
ask me which device I want to unmount=E2=80=A6 Dunno. But thanks for sharin=

P.S. Camale=C3=B3n, please forgive me for sending previous mail directly to

I'm sure Chuck doesn't deliberately leave any Apple User Group off his  
list of forthcoming meetings :)

But your query got me thinking about a few things...

How many Apple User Groups actually maintain a PR mailing list?

If you do, who do you include on it?
Is Chuck from the MUG Center on it?
Sandy, the Editor of the Apple User Group Bulletin?
The Apple User Group Resources website team?
Your Apple Regional Liaison?
Lynn and Fred's InfoManger?
Are other Apple User Groups in your 'area' included?
What about PC-based or Adobe Based user groups?
Your local newspapers, community radio and TV stations?
Local Mayor and other local councillors?
Your local Apple Retail store?
Your local Apple Reseller?
Your sponsors and advertisers?
What about your own Committee/Board of Directors? and even your own  
members?
Anyone else?


What information do you send out to the PR List?
Just an announcement about your next meeting?
What about a teaser for the next THREE meetings?
How often do you send them out? Weekly, Monthly, or just when you have  
a 'major' event?
How far in advance of your meeting do you send them? The day before? A  
week before? Two weeks before?

Do you send HTML based emails? Or just Plain Text?
Do you keep an archive online of your past Press Releases on your  
website?


If you don't have a PR mailing list, why don't you?



PLEASE REPLY TO THE *_LIST_* so everyone can benefit from your

The people who pour the espresso aren't rich.  An interesting issue
might be how it affects employment.

Still, it is a 1% or less sales tax.  That might not make that big of a
difference.  

The costs of tracking revenue and collecting the tax might be onerous.
Worse than the cost of the tax itself.

Me: I hate coffee anyway.  But if they put a $.10/can tax on Diet Dr.
Pepper I might have to start buying them in Oregon.  (Yes, I drink that
much Diet Dr. Pepper)."

also there's catdoc and wv for Word --> text conversions.  actually, wv
consists of wvWare, which as the manpage says ""converts word documents
into other formats such as PS, PDF, HTML, LaTeX, DVI, ABW"".  HTML would
probably be the best format for use with Plucker/SiteScooper, depending
on how good the DOC --> HTML conversion is.  i haven't used either in
over a year as AbiWord or OpenOffice work well enough.  (prefer AbiWord
for it's light-weight size, but OpenOffice has the better DOC importer.)

don't know which of these are better or worse than the other, but i
figure, ""the more the merrier"". ;-)

> You could also try openoffice and/or abiword if you

AbiWord supports exporting to PalmDoc (.pdb) which is about as
PalmOS-friendly as you can get.  never tried/needed it, but it's listed
there in the ""Save As"" dialog box.

Wine (or CrossOver Office, if you already have it) may support Word
Viewer (free download from Microsoft), but didn't a year or so ago when
i last tried.  Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert
Word 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &
paste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only
version of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.

i have a windows (dual-boot) machine, but it only get used by my
significant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any
linux gui app that supports cdrecord's multi-session feature?)  since
OpenOffice, i've been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the
simple Word documents i receive from others).

anyways...

------- Additional Comments From alan@rdrop.com  2002-09-05 22:22 -------
I haven't tried 2.41 yet because it requires File::Spec, which barfs when
spamassassin tries to use it.  I haven't filed a bug yet because I suspect it's
because I'm still running 5.005 perl because of reported compatibility issues
with 5.6 and later, but I probably will because I think there's too much legacy
perl code to put up with major compatibility problems, and spamassassin didn't,
at least in the quickest of looks, say it needed a newer one.  The perl @ stuff
was bad enough...  but this is all a separate soapbox...

I think you're talking about IPFilter, and OpenBSD's new PF code.

Perhaps, although I think when seriously considering something like

I was talking in terms of the actual firewall. If the company in
question knows plenty about Linux and nothing about FreeBSD, I'd go
with a Linux box, merely because when something goes wrong (that
isn't got to do with ipfw/ipchains/ipfilter), then someone knows how
to fix it.

As I said before, I have little to no in-depth experience with
netfilter, I'm aware of it's basic capabilities and had a quick look
at it's features in early 2.4 editions but that's it.

Know that feng shui always works best when it is applied in a subtle way. Do not have little
wind chimes hanging from your computer or bring bagua mirrors and three legged frogs. Find office decor-appropriate solutions to improve your space, solutions that you like and that fit into the overall office environment. Last but sure not least, if you know that your office set-up has challenging feng shui and there is not much you can do about it, make an extra effort to create good feng shui in your home, especially in your bedroom. This will assure that your personal energy is receiving the needed replenishment and support to be able to withstand hours in a questionable feng shui office environment. See what feng shui office energizers you are allowed to bring into your space and go for their best placement. Some of the feng shui must-have for the office are air-purifying plants and high energy items, such as photos that carry the energy of happy moments or bright, inspiring art with vibrant colors. If you have your back to the door, be sure to find a way to see the reflection of the entrance, meaning to have a view of what is going on behind your back. You can do that with any strategically placed office related-object made from shiny metal.

I have been a regular on this forum for several months now, and I
know from experience that the topic of the proprietary nvidia driver
has come up as a topic of frustration many times.  I have a couple
of machines at home with nvidia cards in them, and I plan to do
some research in this area and publish my findings on a web page,
assuming that I can find something useful to say.

But first, I've got to get my taxes done!

43,"Automated forwarding
Hi Folks,

I've been trying to set a button called which automatically
forwards mail using a '-form mycomps' without going through
the editor, but so far haven't got the right recipe.

I currently have in my .exmh-defaults:

*Mops.spam.text:        Spam
*Mops.spam.command:     Msg_Forward -form spamcomps -noedit -nowhatnowproc ; Msg
_Remove


I've also tried with ""SeditSend {$draft $t 0}"" after the forward command.
It should forward to a spam address (where filters get adjusted) and then
delete.  It does so, but not without producing the edit window.

Any help appreciated.

er, i understood you until you reached the above. Maybe its my lack of PHP 
but why would a variable name _need_ to end with [] ?

With most languages you parse the submitted form data and should come out 
with either variables or an array / hash, which you then work with and name 
whatever you like.

They want to preserve binary compatibility for all .x releases. Red Hat

My guess is it's more insidious than that, it's going to be ActiveSpam.

1696,"[Spambayes] DeploymentI think one step towards deployment is creating a re-usable tokenizer
for mail messages.  The current codebase doesn't expose an easy-to-use
or easy-to-customize tokenizer.

The timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical
knowledge about how to parse mail messages, but the module wasn't
designed for re-use.  I'd like to see a module that can take a single
message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one.

I'd like to see the tokenize by customizable, too.  Tim had to exclude
some headers from his test data, because there were particular biases
in the test data.  If other people have test data without those
biases, they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include
them or exclude others.

This step is unneccesary -- unless you've changed the scripts 
much, any test in the logs which aren't in the rules files will 
just be ignored I think.  You do seem to have changed the 
logs-to-c script and removed the bit where you could specify 
immutable tests at the top -- I took a brief glance through the 
code and couldn't fully make out how it had changed.  I think we 
want to be able to specify immutable test scores though in there 
somewhere -- or is that now handled by the tflags stuff?  For 
the last couple releases, any test which occurred infrequently 
(by thumb-in-the-wind subjective criteria) I set to have 
immutable scores, as well as a handful of other rules.

Thomas Jefferson:

""I have examined all the known superstitions of the word, and I do not
find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature.
They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent
men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been
burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this
coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites;
to support roguery and error all over the earth.""

""Christianity...(has become) the most perverted system that ever shone on

As I mentioned in my email to Anders, it's certainly in my code and I don't 
have time to work on it right now, so I would not be offended if you worked on 
it.

I just this moment found out that my partner has promised a few things would be

that it was when I sent the mail to Anders.

Note that timtest.py's current tokenizer only looks at decoded text/* MIME
sections (or raw message text if no MIME exists); spammers could put
megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn't even be looked at
(except that the email package has to parse non-text/* parts well enough to
skip over them, and tokens for the most interesting parts of Content-{Type,
Disposition, Transfer-Encoding} decorations are generated for all MIME
sections).

Schemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers putting
arbitrary amounts of ""nice text"" in the preamble area (after the headers and
before the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, but
which appear first in the file so are latched on to by Graham's scoring
scheme.

But I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that they
exist .  Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that no
particular scheme will gain dominance, and there's no percentage for
spammers in trying to fool just one scheme.  Even if they did, for the kind
of scheme we're using here they can't *know* what ""nice text"" is, not unless
they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their
messages to each different one.  At that point they'd be doing targeted
marketing, and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously.

Read the article.  I'm afraid I don't understand how the transmission
prices could have hit $50/tcf.

But I'm also really leery of telling a pipeline company they have to run
a pipeline at a higher pressure and that they should forego maintenance.
We had a big pipeline explosion up here awhile ago.

So maybe the judge has a point.  We'll see as the appeals work its way
out.

Limbo seems to be able to compile its own kernel with its own gcc 3.1. 
That said, I don't want to know what kind of patches Redhat are applying

Thanks both. (@Andrei: it was in the content of the file, sorry not to
have specified it before.)

I am using the second command. The problem is that, for one set of
files (that I have selected, no problem for this), I have to use a
really simple expression: I need to find all the occurences of
`\paragraph{}' and replace them with nothing (i.e. with `'). I know
regexps, but replacing `$regexp' with `\paragraph{}' gives error
messages. Any idea? Thanks.

467,"Sequence Grabber and Movie Sync - Recording starts earlierHi everyone,

We are struggling with an offset issue in trying to sync a movie
playing in the background with the start of a sequence grabber record.
 The end result of the capture always seems to be ahead of the actual
movie that is playing back.  We are trying to pipe the end result into
an audio echo cancellation library and this offset is causing pain.

Here is the issue.

- We use SGDataProc callback for the recording and preview.
- We start by calling SGStartRecord() for the preview.
- We then PreRoll() the movie and set up all the capture movies.
- We share the SG SoundChannel clock with the movie, and the VideoChannel.
- After this is all complete we call SetMovieRate() to start the
movie.  And then log a time stamp from the clock for recording.  This
happens about 5 seconds after previewing.
- We call AddMediaSample() when the time stamps (adjusted for scale)
passed into the proc are greater than the time set for recording.  We
adjust the audio buffer and sample input so this is cut at the right
time based on the time stamp.
- We are using a USB Audio Mic and a USB Video Camera.
- We have good A/V sync (lip sync)
- When we compare the recorded track to the background track the
recorded echo starts before the echo in the movie.  This is by about
0.1 seconds give or take.  One would expect the echo to happen after
not before.

We have tried to manually offset the time stamp for start time.  But
this then produces A/V sync (lip sync) issues.  I assume this is
because our
video frame is getting there faster than our audio frame.  As one would expect.

Is there any reason why these frames are getting dropped in the
recording?  Does anyone have any ideas to get these 2 in sync.

Thx for your time,
Matt

        I don't particularly want PIM, either.  KPackage, IceWeasel, Ksensors,
NUT, Wine, and WireShark are all I really care about.  Only Ksensors
and KPackage require KDE.  You say, ""no way to keep all of KDE.."".  I
don't care about all of KDE.  I only want KDM and the utilities I

        That's really bad news.  Without KPackage, there really isn't much

IM client vulnerable to attack 
IM client vulnerable to attack 

James Pearce, ZDNet Australia  

Users of messenger client Trillian are vulnerable to attack, according to
information security analyst John Hennessy.

Hennessy has published a proof-of-concept showing the latest version of
Trillian, v0.73, is vulnerable to a buffer-overflow attack that will
allow individuals with malicious intent to run any program on the
computer.

Trillion is a piece of software that allows you to connect to ICQ, AOL
Instant Messenger, MSN Messenger, Yahoo! Messenger and IRC with a single
interface, despite some companies actively avoiding messenger
interoperability.

According to Jason Ross, senior analyst at amr interactive, in June 2002
there were 28,000 home users of Trillian in Australia, about 0.4 percent
of the Internet population, and 55,000 people using it at work, about 1.8
percent of the Internet population.

David Banes, regional manager of Symantec security response, told ZDNet
Australia the code appeared to be valid.

""With these sort of things you have to find some process that would
accept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it to
crash,"" he said. ""Once it's crashed, you can try to find a way to exploit
it.""

He said the proof-of-concept that was published is designed to run on
Notepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system.
He said the problem was easy to fix by ""writing protective code around
that particular piece to more closely validate the data around that
piece.""

""Because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the
checks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all these
buffer overflows and exploits out there now,"" said Banes.

Cerulean Studios, creator of Trillian, was contacted for comment but had
not responded by the time of publication.

It could be an online system that work 95% offline but poll frequently an 
offsite server.  No mass production CDs, maybe mass personalised d/l like Sun 
JDK.

Nothing is fixed yet, we are looking at the way a software can be protected 
from unauthorized utilisation.  

Is the use of ""trusted hardware"" really worth it ?  Does it really make it 
more secure ?  Look at the DVDs.

Microsoft reveals media XP details

Microsoft on Tuesday gave an official name to an upcoming version of Windows XP that aims to make the PC a permanent part of the home entertainment center.
Originally code-named Freestyle, this entertainment version of Windows--which will go by the name Windows XP Media Center Edition--will appear on new PCs and PC hybrids in time for the holidays, the company revealed on Tuesday. With Windows Media Center, consumers will be able to use a TV remote control to catalog songs, videos and pictures, as well as check TV listings.

HP trims Jornada unit in Singapore

Hewlett-Packard has shuffled employees out of its Jornada Pocket PC development unit in Singapore, as the company continues to cut costs following its merger with Compaq Computer.
Jornada products are developed in Singapore and will be phased out by year's end, with the exception of Jornada 720, which resembles a mini-notebook. The model will eventually be rebranded as an HP iPaq device.

Intel, IBM, AT&T Wireless, Verizon Communications and Cingular Wireless are discussing the creation of a company that would build a network of wireless hot spots across the country, The New York Times reported Tuesday. Hotspots are publicly available wireless networks that use the 802.11b standard to deliver Internet access.

1363,"Re: [OT] Ubuntu vs Debian forums (was recompiling the kernel with a 
	different version name)> What I don't understand is why Ubuntu users *post* here, when they
> actually run Ubuntu.

I run Ubuntu and regularly read the Debian list, so maybe I can answer.

If I need to know where is the menus Firefox is, or how to change my
wallpaper, the Ubuntu list is fine. But nobody there understands
_anything_ about the OS. That is fine, the target audience of Ubuntu
is not technical users. The barrier to entry is very low. My
74-year-old mother in law uses Kubuntu.

So if the Debian support is so great, why do I run Ubuntu and not
Debian? Several reasons. One, the low barrier to entry means that I
can get a system up and running in no time flat. Twice a year, 20
minutes and I've got the latest and greatest software versions. Debian
still needs tweaking for my problematic video card, and some other
really small details. But the biggest reason that I run Ubuntu is to
promote it. I have done tens of installs for friends, neighbours, and
family. I need to be familiar with what they are running. Debian just
needs a bit too much work, a bit too much handholding, and a bit too
much explaining things.

So while my heart is with Debian, I run the best Debian derivative out there.

There are no plans for releasing details about TeS. Before the
release of Razor2, I'd pointed out that Razor2 backend (specially
TeS) will be closed.

648,"Re: [Razor-users] ""No razor servers available at this time""I'm still seeing razor reporting bomb out with a small variety of messages.
Would reinitializing something here help, or does razor do that as needed
anyway, and this just reflects trouble at the servers?

Also, since these are reports I'm making from within Mutt, it's annoying
that the error messages garble the X window a bit. If there's nothing
constructive to do about razor failing, can I at least turn off the failure
messages? One way or the other I'd rather not see them.

Good question.  This was covered in one of the amateur rags, maybe Sky
and Telescope or even Scienterrific American, long before there was any
web to speak of, but you'd think a 400km gash in the Earth would be
pretty easy to find ;) I remember it from an issue perhaps in the very
late 80's or early 90's.

It's interesting to note that NT7 and many other NEO bodies are all on
trajectories that approach the Earth from under the ecliptic, so with
the Earth tilt, South America becomes a pretty good target.  In trying
to find you a site through Google, I turned up several different
impact sites in Venezuela and Brazil, with ages ranging from 251M to
70 years, but not the 400km gash from the above story.  

The only google refs I found from that period is one in Arizona
(famous impact crater) and another in NM; do wish I had noted the
actual South American /country/ that contains the scar; Venezuela
sticks in my mind but I can't be certain.

Right you are.  The SRPM includes a patch to enable it, but then the
specfile defaults to not applying that patch.  I saw the former but
missed the later.  Egad, what a convoluted maze.

Sorry for the misinformation!

High pin scores can be thrown off, even without high-scoring dependency
issues, if there are more than two releases involved.

The Debian Project                                http://www.debian.org/

A better DebConf10 with your help: donate or become a sponsor


DebConf is the Debian Project's developer conference. In addition to a
full schedule of technical, social and policy talks, DebConf provides
an opportunity for developers, contributors and other interested people
to meet in person and work together. It has taken place annually since
2000 in locations as varied as Canada, Finland, Mexico, Scotland, and
Argentina. This year DebConf10 is in New York City, New York, USA.

This year, as every year, a great deal of the burden for the conference
is placed on Debian volunteers who donate time and energy to organizing
the conference. Your help would be most welcome. If you are interested
in volunteering, you can contact debconf-team [at] lists.debian.org.

Alternatively, you can help DebConf10 by donating money which will be
used to enable those Debian contributors who currently cannot attend
due to funding shortage. You can contribute money by either becoming a
sponsor (if you are a company) or donating money as an individual.

As Raphael Geissert wrote on his blog: ""DebConf10 needs your help!
That's right: it needs help from potential sponsors and donors to help
cover the costs implied by this event. If you are interested in
becoming a sponsor please contact sponsors [at] debconf.org, or if you
want to make a donation please visit the DebConf10 >donations page [1].

  1: http://debconf10.debconf.org/payments.xhtml

Companies or organizations can, in addition to money donation, lend
equipment for the conference.

Current sponsors of DebConf10 include HP [2], Google [3], Canonical
[4], Intel [5], Collabora [6], Bytemark [7] and Univention [8], plus
our permanent and media sponsors [9]; we thank them for their support
already!

178,"Re: Are bad developer libraries the problem with M$ software?No, you need to learn how declarations work in C.  You have specified
testbuff as ""an array of 1024 pointers to characters"".  That means,
you have allocated an array big enough to store 1024 pointers.  On
most machines, that's 4 bytes per pointer, which indeed would give you
4096.

sorry I pasted the wrong name: --revision actually took effect since the 
generated .deb is now (note the 'lore01')

linux-image-2.6.32.10+drm33.1-recompiled_lore01_i386.deb

but what I need to do is to get rid of '+drm33.1' which seems to be 
automatically added...

the kernel sources are from the ubuntu lucid package 'linux-source-2.6.32'.

My French is a bit iffy these days, but if this is true, does it not also
nullify Microsoft, Adobe and WinZip licences amongst most others? These all
claim no liability, no guarantees (M$ say delivered ""with all faults"", so
at least they are honest).

1570,"Kissinger
[can't think of how I'd be running
afoul of the spam filters with this
post, so here's the second try...]

Kissinger's book _Does America Need
a Foreign Policy?_ provides a few
handy abstractions:

> The ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between
> values [""idealism""] and interests [""realism""] and, occasionally,
> between peace and justice.

Also, he views historical American
approaches to foreign policy as a
bundle of three fibers:

Hamiltonian - We should only get
  involved in foreign adventures
  to preserve balances of power.

Wilsonian - We should only get
  involved in foreign adventures
  to further democracy, etc.

Jacksonian - We should never get
  involved in foreign adventures.
  Unless we're attacked.  Then we
  go Rambo.

He has tactfully left out the hard
realists*; as for the rest I gather
wilsonians play the idealists, and
hamiltonians act where values and
interests intersect, and jacksonians 
act only when values and interests
overlap.

Kissinger himself seems to be a
Hamiltonian; much of the book is
about how he thinks we ought to
be shaping the balance of power
in various foreign regions.

Maybe I've been too affected by
Kant, but I can't see that such
a strategy works unless one can
count on a Bismarck runnning it:
how lopsided does the US look if
everyone tries to run a balance
of power politics?

Kings and tyrants generically have
followed the same power politics:
garner popular support by keeping
potential oligarchs down.  In other
traditions, a king is a legitimate
tyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimate
king.  In the US, I'd hope that we,
like Samuel, wouldn't naturally make
such fine distinctions."

As others have mentioned, rgw command-line parameter $1 probably has a
'/' in it.

A simple workaround is to use a different character as the separator.
That is: *if* you can assume that variable will not contain the
character '|', you can use:

  sed -e ""s|PLACEHOLDER1|$1|' -e ""s|PLACEHOLDER2|$2|""  output

You can use some other characters there as well. See sed(1).

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. 
Tel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236
email : mikebundu@rediffmail.com
Dear Sir/Madam


SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. 

Please permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This
is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a 
dependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange
and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence 
and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the
Democratic Republic of Congo and one of 
the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of
Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may 
his soul rest in peace. 

Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in
my country, I and some of my colleagues were 
instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and
ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. We were then given this money privately 
by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other
Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila 
was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
immediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here
in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the 
said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and
seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava 
(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military
Personnel from our same tribe, by the new 
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President
Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 

In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who
can assist us to move this money out of my country 
as the beneficiary. 
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic
Cover to a security company in Europe in your 
name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked
''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it 
will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. 

Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from
our lack of trust of our supposed good friends 
(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked
with the late President Kabila, immediately 
after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,
the information We gathered from an associate 
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with
your sincere assistance, this transaction will 
be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two
weeks. The said money is a state fund and 
therefore requires a total confidentiality. 

We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this
fund in Europe. This is because we are under 
restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in
order not to lose this fund which we have worked 
so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out
of Congo, you can contact me through my email 
addresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal
information to enable us discuss the 
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.

Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's
Security is Guaranteed if we follow the required 
guidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as
soon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist 
us. 

I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the
utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily 
confidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.
Thank you and God Bless. 
Best Regards 


COL. MICHAEL BUNDU(RTD). m_bundu@rediffmail.com

757,"[dcms-dev] MY INHERITANCEDate:May 16,2002. 
Email:edum@hkem.com. 

Dear Sir, 

I am Mr.Eduado de Mello, one of the Principal 
Commanders of the Union for the Total Independence of 
Angola,UNITA.Well needless telling a very long story 
here for our story is indeed interwoven with the 
history of the world and the liberation struggle in 
the Southern African region of the African continent. 
The bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme 
commander, the late Dr.Jonas Savimbi was killed in an 
encounter with the government forces of the MPLA 
government of my country.The rest is now history but 
suffice it to say that I am tired of the unfortunate 
role of waging a war against my fatherland.I have 
therefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush 
even if the other field commanders decide otherwise am 
therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life 
and I have decided to make South Africa my new home at 
least for the interim period until I am sufficiently 
sure that I would be welcome home whole heartedly by 
the MPLA government in Luanda the capital of Angola. 
Needles to say I was the single most important 
commander who was very close to the late supreme 
commander; Dr.Jonas Savimbi.Indeed because I am a 
brother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great 
deal.The result of such trust is my reason for 
contacting you I was the commander whom he sent to 
deposit the sum of Thirty two million USD ($32million) 
with a security/finance company in South Africa.This 
was immediately after the events of September 11,2001 
in the United States of America.Indeed it had become 
increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money 
around the world particularly for a liberation 
movement like UNITA hence the recourse to keeping the 
money with the security company in South Africa. I 
have decided to inherit this money which was taken out 
and deposited with the said security/finance company 
as cash in Hundred dollar denominations.The money is 
kept in my signature and would have been used in the 
purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of 
continuing the civil war in Angola.The supreme 
commander is dead and as already stated I have decided 
to quite the whole thing and this is without regard to 
the fact that other commanders may wish to continue ! 
I want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit 
the $32million.I am still in the bush here but I have 
been able to establish contact with the company in 
South Africa to the effect that I would soon come to 
take possession of the money that I kept with them. 
Note also that I deposited the money as a foreign 
national who is the head of a Mining company in Angola 
(Never as a commander of UNITA). If you are able to 
cooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20% 
of the $32million.Please come back to me through 
email: edum@hkem.com.The security/finance 
company is standing by to receive my instructions on 
this and I will link you up with them as soon as you 
are ready to take possession of the $32million. 
Finally you are to note that in you reply, you are to 
state your residential or company address and if 
possible send a copy of your international passport so 
as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. 
Yours truly, 
Eduado de Mello

966,"Class Structure QuestionsHi All,

A few questions on class structure.

I am working on an example to create a list of recent files that have been opened.

This obviously involves a UITableView

So I created a class called FileListView and made it a subclass of UITableView like:

@interface FileListView : UITableView

so I call the init method and I want to create the table with the items in it.

Here is what I am not understanding:
1. Using proper MVC, I should have a UITableViewController and for a sequence of events, on init I should create the controller, assign my table to the controller, implement the necessary methods the UITableView requires and them populate the table. it does not make sense to me that on FileListView *fileList = [[FileListView alloc] init]; what I need to do.

I guess I am confused by subclassing my FileListView to UITableView.

Do I create the table controller first, then create the table, then assign the table to the controller and then load the data into the controller so that it is reflected into the table?

2. Where can I find out what methods must be implemented as a requirement for a UITableView, I recall someplace stuff like minimumRows, style, etc.

3. Difference between a delegate and a controller?

I found the table view programming guide so that will help, but can someone explain to me from a more generic stand point? Maybe I need more study on MVC too.

I am not using InterfaceBuilder, btw, but I would think that would be known since I am asking on an Objective-C list....

You need to pay attention to the load state of the QTMovie. Details have
been presented on this list before and are in the QTKit documentation.

Others have probably pointed this out, Lenny has 3.5, the upcoming

That ship has sailed and it isn't coming back.  KDE 3.5 is considered
dead.  Why some motivated person has not forked it yet has escaped me.

If I had the time, resources, and ability, it would be worthwhile to me
to see the KDE 3.5 codebase live on.  If nothing else, the Lenny source
tarballs would be a starting point for a new branch.  I'd expect some
pushback from the KDE devs so it's likely the fork could not call itself
KDE.  Some will say that KDE 3.5 can go no further which was also said
of XMMS which spawned Beep Media Player which spawned Audacious which is
alive and well, last I checked.  As I see it, KDE4 has been given 2+
years to match KDE 3.5 and they've been unable to do so thus the time
has come for someone to seriously consider reviving the KDE 3.5
codebase.

Well, don't go throwing the baby out with the bathwater as we say over
here!  I felt the same way but even though it is quirky, XFCE works
fairly well as does GNOME in Linux Mint 8.  Still, either pales in
comparison to the KDE 3.5 as does KDE4 but at the end of the day, the 
DE is really not why I use a Linux distribution in the first place.  So
jumping to a proprietary OS is not an option.

Agreed.  No matter the distro I choose, they are all Debian based.

Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others Cliff Skolnik at the O'Reilly OS X con 
has tracked down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network 
here -- every 20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages 
from your browser and other net-utilities. Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger wrote 
it up. 

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. 

So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa).

Not yet -- still working on the required config changes.  But I have a

It will!  Part of my cunning plan involves something like this:

  if folder == ""accepted"":             # ie. not suspected junk mail
      if (len(recipients) == 1 and
          recipients[0] in (""guido@python.org"", ""barry@python.org"", ...)):
          folder = ""personal""

If you (and Guido, Barry, et. al.) prefer, I could change that last
statement to ""folder = None"", so the mail won't be saved at all.  I
*might* also add a ""and sender doesn't look like -bounce-*, -request,
-admin, ..."" clause to that if statement.

I believe the SpamAssassin maintainers have a scheme whereby the corpus
of non-spam is distributed, ie. several people have bodies of non-spam
that they use for collectively evolving the SA score set.  If that
sounds vague, it matches my level of understanding.

  Answer to the question from the last newsletter:
  
  Plug your Pocket PC into the USB port on the new TiVo
  Series2, and you can transfer recording onto the handheld to
  watch while you're on the go.
  
  No, this one's false. First of all, none of the proposed
  ""home-entertainment features"" for the Series2 DVRs have been rolled
  out yet. And so far, neither TiVo nor its partners have
  proposed such a feature.

1698,"RE: [ILUG] hard- vs. soft-links [was: How to copy some files ]Use the GUI and don't delete files, use the other option, whats it called
again, the dustbin or something ;-)

Conor who only knows about symbolic links ;-))

I'm pretty sure that I have a softlink from
/mnt/public/mnt/public/downloads/Linux/wasteCPU/setiathome to
/home/cwynne/seti

The /mnt/pub....../seti.. directory resides on an external raidvolume and
/home/../seti is on the internal IDE2 drive. 
So I dont have to cd around the gaf. I suppose that would count as across
different devices. 

If you're wondering [probably not] why /mnt/public is there twice, its
because I restored from tapebackup and I didn't know that it keeps the
directory structure. I know now ;-)

Actually, how can I fix that quickly and easily? I thought about firstly
mv'ing the structure to /tmp. Then copying it back again but I'm sure some
wee genius knows a quickie solution. Mind you I never even bothered trying a
its not a priority now that its all linked anyway. 

CW

--------------------------------
 hum.  interesting variation on the classic technique of
 redefining `rm' to `mv' the files into `./.trash/' (or
 with a prefix of `#' or a suffix of `~'; the variations
 are endless).  these classic techniques only provide a
 means to roll back accidental `rm's, so there is still
 considerable scope for data lost as there are other ways
 of deleting files --- which is not a problem for this
 hard link idea.

 but, like the classic techniques, there is no rolling
 back of accidental overwrites.

 ( rolling back overwrites reminds me of the ""snapshot""
  facility on NetWork Appliance fileservers.  and of the
  various ""versioning"" filesystems which appeared --- and
  then vanished? --- over the years.... )

 one severe(?) gotcha is some files shouldn't have any
 hard links.  both RCS *,v (and hence CVS) and SCCS s.*
 files are like this --- the RCS(/CVS?)/SCCS toolsets
 complain if there are hard links.

Don't use bsddb in a closed-source product.  Use dbm or dumdbm or use
pickles or roll your own thang.  I doubt the presence of bsddb would be the
only barrier to creating a closed-source product based upon the spambayes

Back when 64KB was more memory than any computer would ever need, there was a 
time when memory managers didnt exist. But gradually, new computer systems 
came out with larger amounts of memory and designers discovered ways to eat up 
RAM faster than any system could dish it out. This discussion is based on

NFL 97 to Madden NFL 2002."

Rhapsody rules






I never thought I&#146;d say it, but I&#146;m changing my tune about subscription music services.

When MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late last year, I was unimpressed. Their music catalogs were limited, the software was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.com&#146;s Rhapsody, a subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure recordings from all five major labels. And now I&#146;m rethinking my stance.

Rhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download them to a portable player, you&#146;ll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge, and you can&#146;t download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download MP3s? Let me know at edit@download.com

Here are some representative responses from last week's question on who should take the blame for Web sites not being compatible in every browser:

""Web builders should be doing as much as possible to support the broadest possible usage by their target audience""
A little over half the responses put the onus of compatibility on builders.

""There are far less browser makers than there are Web builders and users. So it doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?.""
After Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this response makes the best argument.

""The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to only one browser.""
Few responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall into the Web user category.

""As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no matter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does.""
Quite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while noting the difficulty of testing in every browser.

""Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the remaining tiny minority has to be justified.""
A few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share browser.

1311,"Win a Green Card and Become a U.S Citizen!
































































The United States has a program, called Diversity Immigrant Visa
Lottery (better known as the Green Card Lottery), making available
each year by random selection 50,000 permanent residence visas
(Green Cards) to people from around the world. The objective of the
program is to issue Green Cards to individuals born in countries with
historically low levels of immigration to the United States.


A Green Card is a Permanent Residence Visa of the U.S.A. A Green Card
will give you legal right to work and live permanently in the United
States. Green Card holders receive health, education, and several other
benefits. If you win a Green Card, you can apply for U.S. Citizenship at
a later time. The Green Card does not affect your present citizenship.
You and your family could be lucky winners!

Let me ""copy/paste"" from the official announcemnet¹:

***
""(...) For this reason, NVIDIA is dropping support, on new GPUs, for the
xf86-video-nv driver.

Details:

- NVIDIA will continue to support the existing functionality and
existing level of acceleration in the nv driver for existing GPUs,
on existing, and (within reason) future, X server versions.

- NVIDIA will not support the xf86-video-nv driver on Fermi or
later GPUs.

- NVIDIA will not support DisplayPort, on any GPU, in the
 xf86-video-nv driver.""
***

So I think the ""nv"" driver will keep the same ""bugs|features"" that has 
right now and will still get some security patches, but I'm afraid that's 
all we (linux users) can expect.

Note that Ubuntu is doing that in a PPA, not in their development
release.  I suspect that Chromium 6 has to wait for libvpx to leave NEW,
and the efforts to build with the system ffmpeg also take quite a lot of
time.

This makes me wonder how Ubuntu obtained their LSB certification,
considering that they do not seem have /lib/ld-lsb.so.3 in any package
either, according to http://packages.ubuntu.com.  The whole LSB seems to
be a joke.

I remember I asked on kde-develop and they said they don't have the
ressources to support it. But what I mean is that someone should care to
get the code compiled on newer libraries. This could be challenging though
if the code is working ATM, it's not that much effort to keep it running at
least for the next few years.

The interest is present I think, but not in the focus of interest of kde
management/development team. I personally could and will make a repo for my
needs ... but it does not seem to be urgent ATM. If someone starts similar
project I would love to know and join.

Hm, so we have to think about doing something like kde3.10 for debian
squeeze. I personally hate k/ubuntu but there are few very useful features
in the 3.10 version there.

This plan could cover 3-4 years. And in that time kde4 should have matured
enough to fit our needs.

As far as I know kde3 is not in squeeze (apps are supported but framework
not) or am I wrong?

What do you think?

regards

 Just for the record, it actually *is* possible to boot off a partition
that's in RAID1, but you might have to use grub. The reason it works
is because grub can read past the md-raid1 metadata without getting
confused -- since the raid is not running when grub is looking at the
disks, it only sees one of the two, but since they're mirrored, and
since grub doesn't *write* to the partition, everything works.

 I have several production systems that do this.

 It's a bit complicated to set up, but generally, it goes
something like:

 - Install a basic system onto one drive, with the correct
   size of partition (call this /dev/sda1).
 - Set up an ""incomplete"" RAID1 array, with one device and
   one missing, with the second drive -- this is /dev/md0,
   consisting of /dev/sdb1 and an empty slot.
 - Configure /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf, and re-build your initramfs
   so that it has the md modules and knows about the array.
 - Mount /dev/md0 somewhere and copy all the data off /dev/sda1 to it.
   It's very important to get the *new* initramfs onto the array.
 - Install grub in the bootloader of the 2nd drive. (The installer
   already did this for the first one). This actually isn't
   essential, but you may need it if/when /dev/sda fails.
 - Boot on to the incomplete RAID array -- root=/dev/md0.
 - Add /dev/sda1 to the array, and sync.

 Now you have a bootable software raid-1 system.

 I'm not saying this solves the OP's problem, necessarily,
but it's perfectly possible. I've never tried it with LILO
or grub2, but I would think it would work.

Yeah, that would work, tho there are race conditions and likely/possible
ugly side effects (eg unintentionally left-over comp files).  I've ended
up taking a very different route: TMDA (http://www.tmda.net).  In
particular I use TMDA outbound filters to add custom plus addresses to
the messages I send to specific lists.

For example, for the tmda-users list I want a From: address of
claw+tmda@kanga.nu, so the relevant outbound filter is:

 to tmda-users@libertine.org ext=tmda

which rewrites my From: header transparently.  When I get next month's
batch of password reminders from Mailman lists I'll be running about
resubscribing to each list either with a standard plus address or a
TMDA-based sender address (ie an address which only the list in question
is able to send mail to).

				  -+-

Getting TMDA fully happy with nmh was a minor pain.  

Reasons:

  nmh, like MH, by default delivers outbound mail via SMTP to port 25 on
  a defined host.  The port number cannot be configured (it calls
  getservbyname() which does a lookup against ""smtp"" in /etc/services).
  Ergo, you are constrained to use tell nmh to use tmda-sendmail instead
  of SMTP.

  Using sendmail as the delivery method under MH instead of SMTP is not
  recommended as is loses a number of useful bits of robustness in mail
  delivery failure modes.  Further, when nmh is configured to use
  sendmail instead of SMTP nmh's whom tool calls sendmail as follows:

    .../sendmail/ -m -t -i -bv

  which creates problems:

    Postfix does not support ""-bv"" and returns in error

    Exim does not support ""-t"" with ""-bv"" and returns in error

    Don't mention Qmail.  I won't use it.

  ""whom"" is far too useful as a component tool in MH to lose.  

    It would be nice if someone gave the new crew working on nmh a shout
    about this.  The ""-bv"" option to sendmail is pretty damned close to
    being Allman sendmail specific and thus unfriendly to other MTAs.
    Further there are many cases where it would be useful to configure a
    non-standard port to deliver outbound mail to via SMTP.  nmh's
    current insistence on only using port 25 (or as specified in
    /etc/services) is a pain.

I've worked out a hack to use TMDA with Exim while retaining nmh's
""whom"" support using Exim's system filter:

  0) Make sure that the following options are set in ~/.tmda/config:

    DATADIR
    ALLOW_MODE_640
    CRYPT_KEY_FILE
    FINGERPRINT

  1) chgrp everything in and under ~/.tmda to group ""mail"".

  2) Configure Exim as per the current TMDA HOW-TO.

  3) Set the following options in exim.conf:

    message_filter = ""/etc/exim/filter""
    message_filter_pipe_transport = address_pipe

  4) /etc/exim/filter reads:

    # Exim filter
    testprint ""local_part: ${local_part: $h_From:}""
    testprint ""domain: ${domain: $h_From:}""
    if ""$h_X-tmda-fingerprint:"" is """" and 
       ""${domain: $h_From:}"" is ""kanga.nu"" and
       ""${if exists {/home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda} {true}{false}}"" is ""true""
    then
      pipe ""/usr/bin/tmda-inject -c /home/${local_part:$h_From:}/.tmda/config""
      finish
    endif

  Yes, that assumes that all user directories are under /home and that
  they use ~/.tmda/config instead of ~/.tmdarc.  Hack appropriately for
  your setup.

Basic explanation:

  Exim sends all outbound mail thru the system filter (if one is
  configured) before attempting delivery.  The above system filter
  extracts the user from the From: address and pipes the message thru
  that user's TMDA setup via tmda-inject.

  The system filter runs as the same user as Exim, thus the requirement
  for the chgrp mail.  If your Exim installation runs as a different
  user, chgrp as appropriate.

  It should be fairly easy to do something similar under Postfix, but I
  haven't investigated that end.

Notes:

  This requires that all outbound mail that is to be processed with TMDA
  has a From: header which references a local user (suffixes are fine),
  and that the From: address is fully qualified with a known domain.  If
  you're vhosting the above setup would be fairly trivial to extend for
  other domains and $HOME paths.  I'm not vhosting on my desktop and so
  don't care.  You could also qualify on envelope or other headers if
  you wish.

  A nice side effect of this approach for those running shared mail
  servers is that ALL users who have TMDA configs instantly get TMDA
  support for their outbound mail -- and in a manner that is less
  complex and less prone to end-user error than the typical TMDA
  configuration.

Caveat Emptor.  

  ObNote: I've also written a small patch against TMDA 0.58 to add a
  ""hold"" delivery method (identical to ""confirm"" except it sends no
  confirmation requests -- very useful for testing configs or doing
  silent sidetracking of mail).

It's there. Scroll down on the downloads page. However you might
consider going the other way and installing SpamAssassin's 2.40

No sir, I am not confusing them. Is just Adobe licence of Flash which is 
not clear enough, I'm afraid. If is ""proprietary"", we have a problem here.

Being proprietary they can stop publishing the specs at any time, at 
their convenience :-/

Thank a lot really useful.

I did install yesterday sid 4.4 .... it's a headache ... so I'll wait until
it works at least half the way.
I'll try squeeze (kde4.3) but I think it was told that it's not pretty food
yet.

So to me it looks like we can safely use kde3 the next 2-3 years.

Subject: [camram-spam] another framework hashcash related framework

There is a framework for using a hashcash like proof of work function
as a way to frustrate junk mailers in this paper:

""Curbing Junk E-Mail via Secure Classification""

by E. Gabber, M. Jakobsson, Y. Matias, A. Mayer Bell

in FC98.

Online copy here:

http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/27735.html

(Look in the view or download section at the top right, it's
availabile in at least .pdf and .ps formats).

The framework they propose with proxies etc looks a lot like the
current camram architecture, with a proof of work to get on a white
list.  They use target revokable email addresses (basically identical
to the LWPA concept) to implement the white list.

The resulting framework is essentially identical to what I proposed in
recent message with:

Subject: target revokable email addresses, and postage-free tokens

Their idea of including the postage free-token in the email address,
mirrors what is done in LWPA and makes the system exhibit smoother
migration for non-users.  eg. you can use varied sender addresses and
it will still work, you can forward the email address to someone else
and it will still work etc.

They have some software architecture diagrams and suggestions for
installing some of the proxies on a corporate gateway -- ""gatekeeper""
they call it.

It gets really entertaining when a RAID array fails in an odd way.  (I 
still cringe about how I learned that md software raid does not always 
kick bad disks out of an array - if a drive is going bad, and just takes 
lots of tries to read data, everything just slows waaa....aaaay down.  
And then unraveling logical volumes on top of software raid can get very 
interesting.)  You learn a lot from such experiences.  Sigh....

30,"Fw: The Gold BuddhaIn 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks
was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move
one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the
idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task.
When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He
shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he
saw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a
hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he
knocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter.
After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before
him a huge solid-gold Buddha.

Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks
several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They
covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks
were killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant
statue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer
shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We
human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we
need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our
outer shell, piece by piece.

Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average
American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why
don't they? It's simple. They haven't been taught that they could. They are
taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money
work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every
month and don't even realize it. In short, they are financially unhealthy.

It looks like you're running via procmail -- what are the permissions
on procmail?  ""Insecure dependency"" screams ""I'm in taint mode!"", which
is a typical problem when procmail is setuid/setgid (the permissions
should be 755).

If this is in fact the problem, an easy solution is to put ""DROPPRIVS=yes""
in the procmailrc. :)

I'll post my own repository story here anyway, hope no-one minds.
It may freely be commented on or used in another text.

I have a directory like this:
$ tree  -d
.
|-- current7
|   |-- SRPMS.current
|   |-- SRPMS.gcc3
|   `-- redhat
|       |-- RPMS.current
|       |-- RPMS.gcc3
|       `-- base
|-- redhat-7_2
|   |-- SRPMS.os
|   `-- redhat
|       |-- RPMS.os -> 
|       `-- base
`-- testing
    |-- SRPMS.testing
    `-- redhat
        |-- RPMS.testing
        `-- base

27 directories

I throw updates to current7's rpms and my own stuff (with makefile :) to
testing.
After each new package, 
nice genbasedir -s --progress --topdir=$TOPDIR/ \
testing/redhat testing

(for -s to work, you need to make release files, pinch someones for

This stuff is found under apache. I put that url, my keys and all that
into apt conf on the machines on the network and apt away.

As for .fi mirrors, funet is very slow. I think I use tuxfamily for
updates but when I see errata I usually also put that to my own one so
rest of the machines have a shorter path to it.
Funet hosts a whole load of mirrors and projects (it used to be (is?)
the main mirror for Linux. It was one of the big pub ftp sites). If
there was a definite apt repository, maybe they might mirror that as
well. I doubt RH would be very keen on using apt and forking a
distribution doesn't seem like an easy option, someone should just start
a project.

The CNET Message Boards are as real as it gets. When it comes down to giving or receiving honest tech advice, there's no better place to be. In the Boards there are no reviews or tests by professionals, just real, true-life experiences and discussions from people like you and me who share one common interest: the love of today's challenging technology. There are no sneaky execs here or scandals to worry about, so if you have a specific problem or question 
in mind, post it! You won't be disappointed.

Why I don't use firewalls
Do you need some honest opinions? Despite all the horror stories that you hear of hackers and Trojans intruding on one's personal computer, hear why one of our veteran moderators refuses to use a firewall. This discussion gets a bit heated, but her point was well taken. Take a look and see why she refuses, and if you have a cent or two to throw in, the donation jar is wide open.

The scoop on USB 2.0
The chances are that the next time you pick up an external computer peripheral, it will be utilizing USB 2.0 to connect to your computer. So what is USB 2.0? Is it that much faster than USB 1.1? Will your current USB port be compatible with peripherals with the new version? Well if you have similar questions, I gathered up some discussion on this topic in hopes that it will bring a better understanding of what's in store for USB 2.0. Take your pick.

Would you happen to have any links to such benchmarks, unofficial or
otherwise?

My experience has been that whenever I look at filesystem benchmarks,
they skip the many-small-files case.  I've always had the feeling that
most of the big filesystems cared a lot about scaling up in file-size,
but not too much about anything else.

I'm a Reiser3 user myself, and I've never had any problems with it.

(The trouble with it being ""long in the tooth"" is mostly hypothetical,
isn't it?)

Yes, the Linux Documentation project is good too.  I go there mainly
for the HOWTOs if I want to research a specific subject.  But for
how to perform typical daily computing tasks using Linux, The Linux
Cookbook is the best that I have found.

""Oh, you want to do that?  Here, type this ...""

That's the kind of everyday usage question that the Linux Cookbook was
designed to solve.  And the second edition is even better.
Unfortunately, it's not available online.  But I liked the original
so well that I bought a hard copy of the second edition.

These days it becomes easier to have a bunch of USB ports than a
bunch of serial ports, so USB/serial converters are cheap and useful
and I've yet to find one that doesn't just work under Debian.

I used to use minicom, but lately I use ""screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600""
or whatever.

I think I'm going to become one of _those_ people. You know, one of those 
people who has a &#8220;Semantic Web&#8221; category on their weblog. This will 
be a Geek Purity Test question someday. Onward: 

- _Phil Ringnalda_: Fun with RDF[1]. &#8220;RDF can actually be fun, as long as 
you don't foolishly invest too much ego in trying to store RSS 1.0, or wander 
off into flame wars.&#8221; From which we find: 
- _Shelley Powers_: The RDF Query-O-Matic[2], and The RDF Query-O-Matic 
explained[3]. &#8220;The Query-o-Matic accepts the name of an RDF file (any 
valid RDF file), and an RDFQL (RDF Query Language) query, and will print out a 
test value found as a result of that query.&#8221; 
- _Marcus Campbell_: &#8220;My FOAF autocreation script is moving along nicely
[4]. It's now looping through my OPML blogroll file, checking the first load of 
bites in people's pages for head linked FOAF files, grabbing certain elements 
from these files (if they have one) and spitting them out into a brand new FOAF 
file for me.&#8221; 
- _Joe Gregorio_: The Well-Formed Web[5]. &#8220;After spending some time 
badgering poor Bill Kearney for a concrete benefit of having RDF in RSS 1.0 and 
not getting a really satisfactory answer I went back and read Paul Ford's essay 
again. I wanted to get that old religious feeling back again. It didn't work. 
The magic was gone.&#8221;

150,"Security update for Debian Testing - 2010-05-07This automatic mail gives an overview over security issues that were recently 
fixed in Debian Testing. The majority of fixed packages migrate to testing 
from unstable. If this would take too long, fixed packages are uploaded to the 
testing-security repository instead. It can also happen that vulnerable 
packages are removed from Debian testing.

Migrated from unstable:
=======================
gnu-smalltalk 3.1-6:
CVE-2009-3736: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3736
               http://bugs.debian.org/559809

Removed from testing:
=====================
The following issues have been ""fixed"" by removing the (source) packages from 
testing. This probably means that you have to manually uninstall the 
corresponding binary packages to fix the issues.
It can also mean that the packages have been replaced, or that they have been 
temporarily removed by the release team to make transitions from unstable 
easier.

webcalendar:
CVE-2010-0636: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0636

CVE-2010-0638: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0638



How to update:
--------------
Make sure the line

	deb http://security.debian.org squeeze/updates main contrib non-free

is present in your /etc/apt/sources.list. Of course, you also need the line
pointing to your normal squeeze mirror. You can use

	aptitude update && aptitude dist-upgrade

to install the updates.

13  Note to readers: Books to give away

      UGNN has accumulated a mountain of books from various
publishers for review. Our samples room is full to the ceiling,
and we would rather find someone who can benefit from these
rather than just hauling to recycling. There are also way
too many to list. So if you're adventurous, and want to
pay the shipping, let us know topics you're passionate
about and we'll send books free.

Let me know.

What should really be the ""big warning"" is mixing releases... I don't see
this as possible however. How is dpkg to know that the libc6 upgrade is not
for security patches or point release?  I suppose something could be put in
place so that the security repo is treated differently.

The best way to avoid this: Don't mix releases. When necessary, its
generally safer to build the source packages. You will also realize how far
you are digging into testing when you start needing to backport libs.

This is potentially reversible, but you should know in the future that core
packages such as libc6, perl, python, and etc should never be mixed between
releases.

I have no advice for fixing the current issue... Only avoiding it in the
future.

I've never experienced speed problems with Adobe Flash plugin. Well,

1424,"[VulnWatch] Foundstone Labs Advisory - Information Leakage in Orinoco and Compaq Access PointsFoundstone Labs Advisory - 080902-APIL

Advisory Name:	Information Leakage in Orinoco and Compaq Access Points
 Release Date:	August 9th, 2002
  Application:	Orinoco Residential Gateway and Compaq WL310
    Platforms:	N/A
     Severity:	The ability to display/modify configuration information
      Vendors:	Orinoco (http://www.orinocowireless.com) and
                  Compaq (http://www.compaq.com)
      Authors:	Marshall Beddoe (marshall.beddoe@foundstone.com)
                  Tony Bettini (tony.bettini@foundstone.com)
CVE Candidate:	CAN-2002-0812
    Reference:	http://www.foundstone.com/advisories

Overview:

An information leakage vulnerability exists in Orinoco and Compaq OEM 
access points, disclosing the unique SNMP community string. As a result,

an attacker can query the community string and gain the ability to
change
system configuration including Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) keys and 
Domain Name Service (DNS) information.

Detailed Description:

The Compaq WL310 is an OEM Orinoco Residential Gateway access point.
Both the Compaq and Orinoco access points use a unique identification
number
found on the bottom of the access point for configuration through
their management client. This identification string is used as the
default SNMP read/write community string. The community strings appears
to be unchangable, unique, and not easily guessable. By sending a
specific packet to UDP port 192, the access point will return
information including the firmware version and the unique identification
value. The packet returned includes the value of system.sysName.0, which
in the case of the Compaq WL310 and Orinoco Residential Gateway,
includes
the unique identification value. The identification value can then be
used as the SNMP community string to view and modify the configuration.

The probe packet:
""\x01\x00\x00\x00\x70\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00""
""\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00""
""\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00""
""\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00""

system.sysName.0 = ""ORiNOCO RG-1100 0392a0""
Community name: 0392a0

Vendor Response:

Both vendors were notified of this issue on July 8th, 2002. According
to Orinoco, ""The Residential Gateway line has been discontinued.""

Solution:

Employ packet filtering on inbound requests to deny access to ports
192/udp and 161/udp on the access point.

926,"Re: Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...)Robert Harley:
>It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly, 
>precisely identical between males and females.

Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.
But that obscures the different modes of
promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for
money or power or companionship and the person
who uses money and power and companionship to
get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
of the word. But their motives and behavior are
quite different.

Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
.. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
the best strategy for female langurs, because
""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs
ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
by the male who is likely next to rule the
roost.

Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
better picture of that. ;-)

=09=09=09Dear Readers,
=09=09=09
On the surface, it seems odd that Microsoft and AOL compete with
one another. After all, while Microsoft is a giant software
powerhouse, AOL Time Warner is totally different--a giant media
powerhouse. Nonetheless, they're at it again, working like crazy
to dominate the ISP space. While AOL is busy renovating the guts
of upcoming AOL 8.0, which will finally integrate the Netscape
browser, Microsoft is nipping at its competition's heels with MSN
8.0. Will Microsoft make enough improvements to finally catch up
with AOL? It just might. Find out more in our MSN 8.0 First
Take.

Ever heard of a type of lawsuit known as a cyberSLAPP? We hadn't eit=
her. A cyberSLAPP case
typically involves ""a person who has posted anonymous criticisms
of a corporation or public figure on the Internet,"" according to
a coalition of privacy groups who are fighting to stop the
practice. Find out more.


First Take: MSN 8.0 Beta

Redmond has been talking up the newest version of MSN for months,
and now, the proof""s in the pudding. Testers have their hands on
the beta of MSN 8.0, and so far, this ISP looks and works better
than past versions. The great No. 8 even has antispam tools and
improved parental controls. But will MSN topple AOL?


First Take: ICQ Lite Alpha

One of our biggest beefs with ICQ has always been its bloated
feature set. Now, the company has released a new lite ICQ that
sucks up far less system memory than the full-fat version--but at
what cost? We take an early look.

These are some of the issues that someone writing portable code
for ASCII vs. EBCDIC implementations needs to worry about.

(1) Collating sequence.  In ASCII, the collating sequence is numbers
(0-9), followed by uppercase letters (A-Z), followed by lowercase
letters (a-z).  Special characters are mixed throughout.  In EBCDIC,
the collating sequence is lowercase letters (a-z), followed by
uppercase letters (A-Z), followed by numbers (0-9).  So records
sorted alphabetically sort in a different order.

(2) Assumptions of continuity.  In ASCII, the codes a-z and A-Z
are contiguous, with no codes in between.  In EBCDIC, there are
six non-contiguous ranges, a-i, j-r, s-z, A-I, J-R, S-Z.  Most
of the codes in between are non-printable characters, but not
all.  For example, ~ sorts above r and below s, } sorts above I
and below J, and \ sorts above R and below S.

(3) Hidden assumptions about control codes.  A program may, for
example, assume that X'0A' is a line feed and hard code it
somewhere.  In ASCII, that is true.  But in EBCDIC, a line feed
is X'25'.

(4) 7-bit assumptions.  In U.S. standard ASCII, all the printable
characters are between the hex values of X'00'-X'7F'.  Codes
above X'7F' are not standard codes.  Historically, these indicate
the combination of the ""Meta"" key with a regular code.  In
EBCDIC, the codes are sprinkled throughout the entire range of
X'00' through X'FF', with the numeric symbol 9 having the highest
code of any normal printable character (X'F9').

This is not an exhaustive list, but it gives you an idea
of what to watch for.  Although the
following table has a few mistakes, this link will give you
an idea of ASCII vs. EBCDIC codes.

(Not disagreeing with the general point.)

For what it's worth, I've been running Eclipse (on 10.6, 64-bit) with
the UseCompressedOoops option for months now - if anyone recalls, Apple
fixed the issue with the default garbage collector so that it now
automatically chooses one that doesn't crash with that option - and it's
very fast.

Of course, I only have my work computer to compare it against (which is
a Pentium 4 PC, with a hard drive that appears to have some kind of
identity issue, since it obviously thinks it's a C64 cassette) - but
still, I don't notice any performance problems.

Also note, I'm sure the behaviour is different on different benchmarks.
I did a quick search and found two benchmarks:

http://www.matsim.org/book/export/html/330
http://blog.juma.me.uk/tag/compressed-oops/

As it happens, both these show a performance win for the option, but
these are only two samples. I'm sure certain usage patterns are indeed
noticeably slower so I agree, if using CPU-critical code where
performance is a concern, it's probably best to work out a repeatable
test and try both options. Just saying, 'assuming' is never a good idea,
but don't assume it'll be slower either. :)

Tourism is the world's largest industry. Using this

would be very valuable.

Online gaming continues to grow. Screw ""Britannia"", 
real-life Britain would be a fun world to wander/
conquer/explore virtually, in role-playing or real-
time-strategy games.

And of course, as James Rogers points out, it's an
ideal display substrate for all sorts of other 
overlaid data. Maps are great, photrealistic 3-D
maps of everywhere which can have many other static 
and dynamic datasets overlaid are spectacular. 

(Combining those last two thoughts: consider the
static world map, in faded colors, with patches
here-and-there covered by live webcams, stitched
over the static info in bright colors... it'd be
like the ""fog of war"" view in games like Warcraft,
over the real world.)

To be more precise, automatic reporting is a Good Thing only if there's
/zero/ possibility of reporting positives falsely (or as close to zero
as makes no difference in the end).

cmeclax's example (which incidentally points out a major vulnerability
of auto-reporting trollboxes) basically says ""I'll blindly report as
spam whatever some other user(s) have reported as spam"".  That ""blindly""
part undermines the very purpose of Razor, so I too hope that:

395,"[spam] [SPAM]  Charity MoneyDear Friend,

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.
My name is MR Wahid Adada a Crude Oil merchant in IRAN,i
have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and
right now I have only about a few months to live,
according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was never
generous, I was always hostile to people and only
focused on my business as that was the only thing I
cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have
or make all the money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come
to this world I would live my life a different way
from how I have lived it. Now that God has called
me, I have willed and given most of my property
and assets to my immediate and extended family
members as well as a few close friends.
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul
so, I have decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed
money to some charity organizations in Austra, cameroun,
liberia,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself
anymore. I once asked members of my family to close
one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have
there to charity organization in Bulgaria and
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left
for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the
huge cash deposit of fifteen million dollars
$15,000,000,00 that I have with a finance/Security
Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.


I have set aside 10% for you and for your time.

God be with you.

1201,"Content management for MP3sDear flatware,

I'm about to undertake a massive project to index/catalog well over one 
thousand CDs that have been ripped to MP3 and set up a server to stream 
them to different rooms in the house. (Yes, I own them all, no I'm not 
broadcasting them to the 'net.) Can anyone give me some recommendations 
as to what (free? opensource?) software is best suited for this task? I 
know there are a few FoRKs out there who have tackled this problem before...

I'd like to be able to dynamically generate play lists from queries like 
""Jazz released between 1950 and 1960"" or ""Artist such and such between 
these dates"" or ""Just these artists"" or ""Just this genre"" - you get the 
idea. In addition to having multiple streams that I can tune in to (a la 
DMX), I'd like to be able to browse the database through a web interface 
from other computers in the house and pull specific music down to 
wherever I am.


Thanks,
Elias"

1027,"Re: [ILUG] CVS question?Well, as many have said, it's non-trivial and not smart enough.

I did try just cvs'ing over the existing sources, but cvs complained that my 
files were in the way.

Then I thought that I'd only need the DRI stuff, that took about 1.5 hours to 
fetch 116M. Unfortunately I still need the XFree86 cvs stuff as well :-( At 
339M that took almost 3 hours.

Now I can start building the XFree86 cvs and DRI cvs stuff for testing the 3D 
patches for my GVX1 card. I just hope I don't completely trash my system in 
the process. 

Think I'll wait until morning to start building, though. I've been building a 
new box from source this week. A 200Mhz PentiumMMX with 96M. It took a full 
day to build XFree86 4.2.0 and 2.5 days each to build qtlibs and kdelibs. 
kdebase took just under 46 hours. I've got lots of grief from the wife for 
the computer running 'round the clock this week. The rest of KDE should build 
in under 20 hour increments.

Cheers,

	John Gay

Subject: [ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2


Folks,

my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.


Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard
disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which
went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.

I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia
GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's
default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using
RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),
but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?

Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock
twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch
is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.

If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.

Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?
Opinions
welcome.

Thanks a lot,
Peter

Hi,

Sorry for the ambiguity.

by files/folders I meant the number of objects inside a directory.

But Mike showed there is no such limit for files/folders and other
showed me there is such a limit for folders.

folders=directory.

I work in a mixed environment of BSDs Linuxes Mac OS X and a few MS
Windows Servers but the developers mostly use MS Windows as desktops
and MS language is what I use commonly in office so that is the reason
to use folders :-)

I rarely use ext3. This was a server installed by some body else.

The folder limit was reached some time back.

As a temporary solution some directories were removed .
They will be fitting new drives tomorrow so I guess i will format them
to XFS and use that.

since ext4 also has a limit ans jfs also has a limit of 64000 I guess
I will use XFS which allows 2^32 directories under a directory.

My inclination to use JFS was because that is the file system that has
proved stable for me during numerous crashes due to power failure back
at home more than any other :-)

Thank you so much all of you for all the info.

I would be.  And do we not mean Squeeze?  Lenny has KDE 3.5.10.

I have looked at all those, in addition to KDE 4 and Gnome.  None appeals t=

me.  Each has something that I strongly dislike or does not have something=

that I like and use a lot.  I would love to be able to upgrade to Squeeze i=
f=20
new(er) hardware dictates, but keep KDE 3.5.  But I am not even almost=20
tempted to go over to the dark side!

I am, however, very sad that KDE 3.5, which I regard as the pinnacle of DE'=
s,=20
is being laid to rest.

Point the first, I doubt if they are trying to change Rumsy's mind but
rather to show others that there is a vocal and violent opposition to his
views. With such flagrant showings of opposition there would be more
coverage of the opposing ideas and thus the spreading of the dissenting
meme. A viri need not comply with the wishes of the attacked host, rather
the host had better make some antibodies or learn to adapt.

Point the second. Historicaly the ""in yer face"" mode of confrontation has
been used to gain popular support and to grow from seeds ""grass roots""
movements. Witness the big bold ""in yer face"" signature of Hancock on the
""in yer  face"" Declaration of the american colonies to the governing
powers of england. Witness also the chicago seven, Others will follow in
examplare  form upon digging.

Now point the third, is it annoying? Yes, and if your annoyed then the ""in
yer facers"" have done thier job. Sad to say the polite persnikiters are
teh very fule the ""in yer facers"" hope to ignite. If your burning, your
being used.

Pointed the personal...The politics of the polite are more often the
refuge of backstabings,  closed mouth recourlessness and hypocritcal
behavoirs. Id rather hear what those who oppose me have to say than
quietly be knifed by the slow hand of the coward.



Seek not the polite or impolite but rather the reasons why.

You open sourced the new components you developed for this project, so the

Email Marketing








  
  
    
        
  
The power of Email Marketing 

 
   
   
   
  Email Marketing is spreading&nbsp;around the whole&nbsp;world                   
  because of its&nbsp;high effectiveness,&nbsp;                 
  speed&nbsp;and&nbsp;low cost.                  
                  
                  
                  
                    
  Now if you want to introduce and sell your product or service,&nbsp;look for                   
  a&nbsp;partner to&nbsp;raise                   
  your website's reputation. The best way would be for you&nbsp;to&nbsp;use&nbsp;email                   
  to contact your        
  targeted customer (of course,first,&nbsp;you&nbsp;have to&nbsp;know their email addresses).                  
                 
                
                
                
  Targeted Email is no doubt very&nbsp; effective.&nbsp;                   
  If you can introduce your product or service&nbsp;                  
  through&nbsp;email directly to the customers&nbsp;who are interested&nbsp;in                   
  them,&nbsp;&nbsp; this will&nbsp; bring&nbsp;your&nbsp;

1004,"Encryption approach to secure web applicationsHi everybody!

I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database 
access with postgreSQL).

This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a 
framework for other web applications.

The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.

I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the 
database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.

Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.

A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for 
encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), 
and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. 

I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not 
the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the 
database, but the database is accessible from the web application. 
Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the 
database password, I can use a different database with different 
user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.

Where I can found good documentation about this topic?

There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I 
thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. 
After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to 
learn methods and technics.

First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so 
I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach 
could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user 
(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the 
nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory 
or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.

The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in 
the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small 
bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source 
is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the 
db connection/password to the main web application.

In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in 
shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user 
account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your 
provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java 
application (that means, really, another server running in the 
background).

Any suggestions?

Thank you,
Mario Torre

    What's the official ""apt"" line for it?  Is it just 7.4 instead of 7.3, or did they make this one 8.0?

This is true. Even if you don't see the box, moving the mouse over its 
invisible border shows corresponding events.

Looks like a bug, but not in xev, because running xev via ssh on a

Please forgive me if my choice of words offended you.  That wasn't my
intention at all.  I was speaking figuratively, not literally.  My point was
that swapping out the production switch, which probably has others users
plugged in, shouldn't be the first troubleshooting step, especially if it's
a managed switch and can thus show per port configuration and traffic data.

This data usually shines a bight light on these types of issues.  Usually
the problem in cases like the OP is having relate to VLAN configuration.  On
manyy/most managed switches which have global VLANs already configured, but
not all ports configured, if you plug a PC into an unconfigured port the PC
sees a dead network.  The solution is to add that port to one or more
appropriate VLANs.

Tech's Major Decline
College Students Turning Away From Bits and Bytes

By Ellen McCarthy
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, August 27, 2002; Page E01

If John Yandziak had been entering college a few years ago, he might have
sought a stake in the ""new"" economy. He might have dreamed of becoming an
ace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined
toppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to
use the Internet to end world hunger.

But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboring
different academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do
something more social and more interesting than working with computers.

Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, ""you
can't get the chicks with that anymore.""

The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of
some fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the tech
bust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has
come to a halt.

The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in
2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And
educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some
colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.

The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickled
into the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of
Computing Machinery.

""I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic
declines,"" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering
at Princeton University in January. ""It can be hard to see this, because at
some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far
exceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.""

At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science
department will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington
University, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer
science fell by more than half this year.

Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the
past decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and
computer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing
Research Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees
were awarded.

The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the
fastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other
computer-related industries trailing close behind.

But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among
college students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying
information technology and engineering at George Mason University were
computer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is
down to 800, although a newly created and more general information
technology major has attracted 200 students.

""Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,"" said Lloyd Griffith,
dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school.
""Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four
years on something and then not get a job.""

Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science major
is expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland
decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does
not account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College of
Computer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.

""We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their
interest in pursuing computer science as a major,"" Halperin said. ""That's a
factual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expect
to see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no
longer expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.""

Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not
convinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,
with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his
advanced-placement exam in computer science.

""All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,
so I looked for professions in which I could use those things,"" Yandziak
said. ""I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I
want to do something that will contribute to the practical world.""

Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,
salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.

""There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have the
same sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need this
kind of IT training right now,' "" Miller said. ""Our concern as an industry
is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the
road four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to
find themselves in a shortage situation.""

Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other
factors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social
influences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional
development at the American College Counseling Association. The perception
of computer science as an isolating, ""nerdy"" profession is one that many in
the industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during
the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.

""All the hipness is gone,"" Yandziak said. ""Once we thought of the Internet
as this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that
came along.""

Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in
the District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business
marketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.

""Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,""
Thompson said. ""To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I
think of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's a
necessity, but I wouldn't take it any further."""

Forwarded-by: Sven Guckes 

http://news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,5037762%255E13762,00.html

Port San Luis, California
September 05, 2002

A WHALE which suddenly breached and crashed into the bow of a
fishing boat killed a restaurant owner on board.

Jerry Tibbs, 51, of Bakersfield, California, was aboard his boat,
The BBQ, when the whale hit and tossed him into the sea five miles
off Port San Luis.

Three other fishermen stayed aboard the damaged boat, which was
towed to shore by the US Coast Guard.

Tibbs and his three friends were just ending a day fishing for
albacore when the accident occurred, authorities said.

Tibbs' body was found after a search lasting more than 18 hours
Coast Guard officials said it was the first time they could recall
an accident caused by a whale hitting a boat."

Lovely quote from the Forbes 400 list:
""and not a single Astor, Vanderbilt or Morgan rates a mention on the
current Forbes Four Hundred. ""

But you have to studiously ignore the 4 Rockefellers, 3 Gettys, 3
Hearsts,  Fords, Kelloggs, Wrigleys,
and so on.

There are more self-made people on the list than I previously alluded to
- I made a mistake. Most
of them seem to have Ivy League educations, or are Ivy League dropouts,
suggesting to me that they weren't
exactly poor to start with. Some of them have lovely self-made stories

All the stuff at debian-multimedia can't be included in debian for
various reasons, mostly freedom I think, so you won't find it in debian
at all. It's made for debian but it isn't debian.

I started using d-mm.o from the reply to a question I posted in this
list many years ago and I suspect most people still find it today the
same way.

be your upstream ISP is being more aggressive too...

If we only offer toll free (800) access in your area then residential service is $63.00. No hidden fees, just one low monthly rate billed to your credit card or drafted from your bank account.

 Xserver has a well known issue with the i915 driver and it's DRI/DRM 
  limitation to 2048x2048 window size. So the default setup is not working 
  because in recent versions of X it loads drm by default creating 
  configuration that allows only  ""clone"" of the primary display with DRI 
  enabled on it.
  The impact on kde is that it can not set dual display (only ""clone"" option 
  is available).
  SOLVED: applying custom xorg.conf with 
        Option ""NoAccel"" ""true""
  in the device section and Position Option into each monitors config.

CMP, owners of [0]The Perl Journal, have brought the journal back, in the
form of an online monthly magazine, in PDF form. The subscription rate is
$12 a year. They need 3,000 subscriptions to move forward (no word if
existing subscriptions will be honored, or included in the 3,000).
[0]Read the site for more details.

I think some of the more interesting notes are that it will include ""a
healthy dose of opinion"", as well a broadening of coverage including
languages other than Perl (will this mean a name change?) and platforms
other than Unix (I'd always thought one of TPJ's strengths was that it
covered a wide variety of platforms).

                                >> MINI NEWS > ANTI-NEWS > EVENT QUEUE > TRACKING > MEMEPOOL > GEEK MEDIA > the objection that ""Elvis - was a hero to most, but he
         never meant shit to me"" is addressed in ENTERTAINING ELVIS
         (1.35am, Fri, ITV), in which ""The King"" offers his views on
         our modern-day pop acts... the horror continues in the form of
         CANDYMAN II (1.10am, Fri, C4) and William Peter ""The Exorcist""
         Blatty's psycho-nonsense THE NINTH CONFIGURATION (2.45am, Fri,
         C4)... and Jason ""Seinfeld"" Alexander plays one of a bunch of
         gay friends - not that there's anything wrong with that - in
         LOVE! VALOUR! COMPASSION! (12.40am, Fri, C5)... Jarvis Cocker
         *is* Rolf Harris, while ""Allstars"" impersonate the recently
         deceased ""Steps"" in CELEBRITY STARS IN THEIR EYES (8.30pm,
         Sat, ITV)... Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma ""Legally Blonde""
         Blair put the ""les"" back into ""Les Liaisons Dangereuses"" in
         their noted http://www.girlskissing.co.uk/video.htm classic
         CRUEL INTENTIONS (9.30pm, Sat, C4)... leading into a late-
         night character actor fest featuring Paul ""Boogie Nights""
         Anderson's feature debut HARD EIGHT (12.35am, Sat, BBC2),
         David Mamet's Steve Martin con-game THE SPANISH PRISONER
         (1.20am, Sat, C4), and Oirish juvenile delinquent coming-of-
         ager THE BUTCHER BOY (12.55am, Sat, C5)... things get back to
         normal on Sunday with the incomprehensible remake of MISSION:
         IMPOSSIBLE (8.15pm, Sun, BBC1) - not to be confused with the
         simultaneously fruitless THE HUNT FOR THE ANTHRAX KILLER (9pm,
         Sun, BBC2)... Christina Ricci, Lisa Kudrow comedy THE OPPOSITE
         OF SEX (10pm, Sum, C4) has snappy script, no plot... and it's
         the final episode of the seemingly interminable 24 (10pm, Sun,
         BBC2): http://www.doyourecall.co.uk/ ... the - presumably
         rhetorically titled - DID BARRY GEORGE KILL JILL DANDO? (9pm,
         Mon, C4) and WHO KILLED SIMONE VALENTINE? (11.05pm, Mon, C4)
         are helpfully scheduled either either side of SIX FEET UNDER
         (10pm, Mon, C4)... Michael ""David St Hubbins"" McKean moves
         into management in sub-""Spinal Tap"" hostage romp AIRHEADS
         (10.55pm, Mon, C5)... the consistently worrying TEENAGE KICKS
         (10pm, Tue, C4) looks at ""Teenage Dwarfs"" - next week:
         ""Teenage Dirtbags""?... and http://www.diffusiononline.net/
         inspiration BARGAIN HUNT (8pm, Thu, BBC1) arrives on prime-
         time - frankly we still prefer his mix of ""147 Lockdown""...

         FILM>> if they'd used the proper mathematical sigma symbol in
         the title, then the sequel could have been called ""The
         Derivative Of Distress - With Respect To Terror"" for largely
         humourless feelgood nuclear thriller THE SUM OF ALL FEARS
       ( http://www.screenit.com/movies/2002/the_sum_of_all_fears.html :
         We see [Bridget ""Coyote Ugly"" Moynahan] in bed, showing some
         cleavage; the camera briefly focuses on some cheerleaders'
         clothed butts during the Super Bowl)... oh and it's the full
         release this week for SPY KIDS 2: THE ISLAND OF LOST DREAMS
         ( http://www.capalert.com/capreports/spykids2.htm : telepathy;
         pelvic thrusts by a child; drinking with multiple drugging;
         ""Let's kick their [posteriors]"" - which is not included in the
         list of three/four letter word vocabulary but is impudent;
         toilet humor - smothering in a pile of dung with fecal matter
         in mouth)...

         CONFECTIONERY THEORY>> ""Are you tracking breakfast cereal?""
         inquired a concerned LLOYD WOOD, after recently wandering into
         the ""kiddy end"" of the cereal aisle. ""They've all gone CD-ROM
         on the front"", he observed - causing him, for a moment to
         think he was looking at ""some really bloated computer
         magazines"". Of course we are, Lloyd, though we're not as
         easily swayed by gimmicks as you are, and thus can impartially
         report that NESTLE's Maryland-style COOKIE CRISP are the most
         biscuit-like breakfast ever, easily triumphing over KELLOGG's
         FROSTIES CHOCOLATE (too much chocolate, not enough ""frosty""),
         COCO POPS CRUNCHERS (clump together in this humid weather) and
         even the Winnie The Pooh-themed DISNEY HUNNY B's - and if you
         mix them all together, the milk goes so chocolatey it'll turn
         your Pooh brown... elsewhere in dairy, MCDONALD'S continue a
         disappointing run of toppings for the MCFLURRY (99p) -
         Cadbury's Caramel is rubbish, and Jammie Dodgers not a patch
         on our second-favourite McFlurry of all time, the Strawberry
         Crunch: http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02001-08-10&l=286#l .
         Reader ED AVIS complains that KFC don't tell you that their
         ""M&M"" AVALANCHE (also 99p) does not feature real M&Ms but
         ""special miniaturised ones"", which he describes as ""frozen
         solid"" and ""might as well be small bits of gravel for all the
         chocolate flavour they impart"". While, following last week's
         announcement of Ice T's Posse Pops, CRAIG LEFF thought we'd be
         reassured by the news that NBC are launching their own range
         of TV-themed Baskin-Robbins ice-creams, including a ""Fear
         Factor"" flavour designed to recreate the experience of eating
         ""dirt and spiders"": http://www.adage.com/news.cms?newsId=35520
         ... back with confectionery, LEON VERRALL remained unimpressed
         with STARBURST FRUITINESSE (from 49p, ""tasted of plastic...
         [resembled] those 'food pills' they thought we'd all be eating
         by now""), DAVID BLANE grudgingly approved of the TWIX TRIPLE
         CHOC LIMITED EDITION (""Not bad, faintly evoking Penguins,
         which I never liked because of the thick chocolate""), and the
         whole point of that controversial ""It's not for girls""
         campaign was revealed: to position NESTLE DOUBLE CREAM (40p)
         as a more female-friendly version of the YORKIE BAR. Other
         treats to look forward to in coming weeks: Cola-flavoured
         CADBURY-TREBOR REFRESHERS, chicken-wings-flavoured HULA HOOPS,
         bacon QUAVERS, the (presumably) non-crisp-like GOLDEN WONDER
         FRUIT WONDERS - or, indeed, any of this weird new American
         stuff: http://www.candyusa.org/Press/New/ace2002.shtml ,
         ranging from SCORNED WOMAN CHOCOLATE JALAPENO FUDGE to SOFT
         AND CHEWY STINKY FEET (""Mmm, these feet are *so* stinky"")...

Simple answer:

http://patch-tracker.debian.org/package/asterisk/1:1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny1

So they are mostly bristuff. However they include other fixes (including
some fixes that were never accepted by Junghanns due to bad
communication).

There are some other changes apart from the bristuff fixes and we can't
simply call it ""bristuffed"".

Yes, you can increase the log verbosity:

Verbosity 4
LogFile /var/log/hibernate.log
LogVerbosity 4

And check that file after suspending/restoring.

But if you already got a success resume, why are you in the need of 
blacklisting modules? :-?

This wouldn't be worth the effort involved IMHO, and would probably end up
in relative breakage of a few systems if not carefully tested.
Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier
currently :
1. Leave your current kernel as-is
2. Get the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm
3. Rebuild and install resulting packages

Drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,
NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported
as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.

Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in
my mind. I see it more as a ""one size fits all"" achievement in the general
case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized
for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules
you'll ever need. Make that ""one size fits many"" then if you want ;-)

Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from
in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their
systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and
other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily
use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release
without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.

5 of teh 19 Atom CPUs support x86-64.  Which kernel are you running?  32bit

Ok, some more nits: alsa-xmms doesn't work if I don't have
alsa-lib-devel installed, but xmms dies on startup telling me:

   Cannot load alsa library: libasound.so: cannot open shared object
   file: No such file or directory

libasound.so is part of alsa-lib-devel... if I install it, the ALSA XMMS
output plugins works fine.

I can't install the xine stuff, because xine-libs needs libGLcore.so.1,
which I can't find anywhere (NVidia stuff?  I have Radeon 7500...)

Yea, and that on top of the 100x of all the parsing engines over just
bigendian'ing it and passing the data (5x+++) in the raw. Then it REALLY

1239,"Suspend to Disk + blacklisted module = still troublehello,

I am having problems with the uvcvideo module (driver for webcam)
when resuming from Suspend To Disk on Debian Lenny (with the latest
updates) with a 2.6.30 kernel.

When I wanted to blacklist this module for suspend, I noticed that
it is already in /etc/hibernate/blacklisted-modules.

My hibernate.conf:
TryMethod suspend2.conf
TryMethod disk.conf
TryMethod ram.conf

=> so I guess I am using SWSuspend2, and suspend2.conf contains
the line:
Include common.conf

And common.conf contains this:
UnloadBlacklistedModules yes

So does this command cause hibernate to read
/etc/hibernate/blacklisted-modules, or do I have to add
UnloadModules uvcvideo
?

Dear Investor,

Thank you again for requesting our free special 
report, ""The One Stock that Keeps Wall Street 
BUZZING.""

We began The Motley Fool in 1993 with the idea that 
investors like you deserved better. 

Better than Wall Street's all-too-often biased 
research...  Better than analysts who speak in ""secret 
codes"" allowing them to hedge or spin any 
recommendation...  and better than what passes for ""full 
financial disclosure"" in big business today.

Given a level playing field, we believe that regular 
folks -- like us, and you -- can do quite well in the 
stock market. Why put trust in conflicted information 
from others when you could count on your own 
abilities, and potentially blow the pros away? 

More than two million people visit our Fool.com web 
site each month.  We spend a great deal of time at 
Fool.com instructing people HOW to invest, but not so 
much about WHERE to invest. 

And that's why we created the Motley Fool Stock 
Advisor.

You are cordially invited to join us as a Charter 
Subscriber to Motley Fool Stock Advisor as we focus on 
the great companies of the U.S. stock market.

insights to help you achieve your financial dreams.

Stock Advisor newsletter delivered to your home each 
month -- a personal communication from us, David & Tom 
Gardner.  We'll tell you exactly why we believe a 
stock is poised for significant growth -- and give you 
all the facts to back that analysis up.  You'll get 
the good, the bad and the ugly on every recommendation 
we make -- so you can make each investing decision 
with great confidence.

Of course, there's more to our Motley Fool Stock 
Advisor than our monthly newsletter.

You'll also receive our monthly, between-issue, e-mail 
Fool Flash to help you take full advantage of breaking 
opportunities.  And you can log on anytime at the 
Motley Fool Stock Advisor subscriber-only Web site, 
featuring current & back newsletter issues...full 
updates on our selected stocks...Q & A...and more.

Thanks for your replies.... However i still cant get it to detect the External USB modem. I also have an internal 56k fax modem, but i cannot get that detected either ( maybe its because it was designed for Windows and is not supported ). Im not going to buy a new modem ( I think 2 is more than enough for 1 PC ).

It could well be my inexperience with Linux that is making this more difficult, but whatever it is iv just about had enough!! Any last gasp ideas would be welcome

Many Thanks

The whole virtuoso/strigi ensemble needs a lot of polishing. It is not ready 
for simple usage yet.
I have spent some days fiddling with that stuff based on my own experience and 
feedback i got from users at sidux.
The best way i found to have a usable index is:
 - stop nepomuk and strigi in systemsettings
 - move away or delete everything in: 
~/.kde/share/apps/nepomuk/repository/main/data/virtuosobackend
(there might be incompatible database from virtuoso 5.x in there)
 - out and back in to your account
 - start nepomuk andv strigi
 - let it do the indexing
 - test (in dolphin, krunner is unreliable atm) your index
 - see if e.g. files under kmail got indexed

for me to have a complete index i had to do 5 runs of strigi.
in the first 3 runs it would not even touch any dot files under .kde
in the end it works fine now but popular searches use a lot of ram.

regards
Ferdinand

Here's hoping that tradition perseveres for the novelist
currently on trial in Paris for calling Islam ""the stupidest
religion""...

http://ca.news.yahoo.com/020917/5/ozxa.html

# Tuesday September 17 11:07 AM EST
#
# French Writer Tried As Anti-Islam, Protest Erupts
# By Caroline Brothers
#
# PARIS (Reuters) - Provocative French novelist Michel Houellebecq
# faced a Paris court on Tuesday for allegedly inciting racial hatred
# by calling Islam ""the stupidest religion"" and its holy book the
# Koran a depressing read.
#
# The case, brought against him by four Muslim groups, is a cause
# celebre reminiscent of the Salman Rushdie affair, pitting freedom of
# expression against religious sensitivities.
#
# The Muslim groups, which include the Mecca-based World Islamic
# League and the Paris Mosque, accuse the writer of insulting Islam in
# an interview with the literary magazine ""Lire"" during last year's
# launch of his novel ""Plateforme.""
#
# Lire is also on trial over the remarks, which have taken on an added
# significance in France in the atmosphere of heightened sensitivity
# and concern about Islam following the September 11 attacks by Muslim
# radicals in the United States.
#
# Shortly after the trial started, 11 people in the courtroom stripped
# off their shirts to reveal T-shirts saying ""No to the censure of the
# imams"" and ""Marianne veiled, Marianne raped"" -- a reference to the
# female symbol of the French republic.
#
# ""Freedom of expression! freedom of expression!"" they and other
# Houellebecq supporters chanted after they were thrown out of the
# courtroom at the main law courts in central Paris.
#
# While intellectuals argued before the trial that Houellebecq should
# be free to write what he wants, Lyon Mosque rector Kamel Kabtan
# retorted: ""We are for freedom of expression, but not for insulting
# communities.""
#
# BETE NOIRE
#
# Houellebecq, 45, the bete noire of contemporary French literature,
# is no stranger to controversy. He offended conservatives and the
# politically correct left with his 1998 novel ""Les Particules
# Elementaires"" (""Atomised"" in English).
#
# Paris Mosque rector Dalil Boubakeur says Muslims have been insulted
# once before by Houellebecq, who had the main character in Plateforme
# admit he felt ""a quiver of glee"" every time a ""Palestinian
# terrorist"" was killed.
#
# The World Islamic League, the Lyon Mosque and the National
# Federation of Muslims in France have joined the Paris Mosque in
# bringing Houellebecq to trial.
#
# France's Human Rights League joined them as a civil party, saying
# Houellebecq's comments amounted to ""Islamophobia"" and deserved to be
# sanctioned as part of the league's struggle against discrimination
# and racism.
#
# The Paris Mosque has hired Jean-Marc Varaut, one of France's leading
# trial lawyers, whose past clients include Maurice Papon, the former
# official condemned in 1998 for Nazi-era crimes against humanity for
# sending Jews to death camps.
#
# RESTORING BLASPHEMY?
#
# Houellebecq's lawyer Emmanuel Pierrat argues that the case
# effectively re-establishes the notion of blasphemy, despite the fact
# that France as a secular state has no such law, and says
# Houellebecq's opponents want to deny him freedom of expression.
#
# He also argues that the interview in Lire truncated a six-hour
# conversation and Houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the
# article before it appeared.
#
# Houellebecq's publisher Flammarion has distanced itself from the
# author, whose comments some say may have cost him France's
# prestigious Goncourt prize -- for which he had been a contender.
#
# The novelist, who lives outside Cork, Ireland, writes in a detached
# style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to
# love.
#
# Translated into 25 languages, ""Atomised"" incensed France's 1968
# generation with its scathing descriptions of the hippie era but won
# him France's November prize in 1998 and the Impac award, one of the
# world's biggest fiction prizes.
#
# Losing his case may mean a year in jail or a $51,000 fine.

291,"Re: Xorg and cpu usageConcerning Xorg, look through the log file /var/log/Xorg.0.log, e.g.,
the command

$ grep -i dynamic

should tell you if power saving (""Dynamic Clock Scaling"") is enabled or not.

Generally, the problem of energy consumption can be tackled with the program
powertop best called as root. Maybe, it can tell you the culprit for the
observed cpu usage.

Canning spam without eating up real mail

Like a growing number of Web surfers, Audrie Krause faces a new uncertainty when she hits the send button on her e-mail these days: Will the message get through?
As the head of a political action group, Krause uses members-only e-mail lists to help educate and organize fellow activists. So she was jarred recently when one message bounced back with a note accusing her of spreading unsolicited junk e-mail, or spam.

Tech companies chase homeland security

Software companies looking for greener pastures are turning to the red, white and blue.
Whether out of heartfelt patriotism in the wake of Sept. 11 or the desire to tap into the nearly $38 billion budgeted for homeland security spending in 2003, many information technology companies that previously paid little attention to government contracts are now going to great lengths to attract government business.

Lukewarm response to Juniper moves

Juniper Networks continues to muddle through the telecom morass.
Juniper beat estimates by earning less than $500,000, reported a 42 percent decline in year-over-year sales and offered little hope that it could grow its business when it reported 2002 second-quarter earnings on Thursday. Yet in some corners of the industry, Juniper's performance was viewed as mildly positive.

National newspaper USA Today said Friday that one or more online vandals had posted a fake front page and six phony news stories on its Web site.
Network administrators have yet to determine how the vandals compromised the company's Web server Thursday night. The national newspaper has called in local law enforcement to help find out who defaced the site with fake stories.

Wireless lands at European airports

Network giant Cisco Systems is installing Aironet wireless LANs into lounges at 19 airports across Europe, targeting business travelers with wireless cards in their laptops or personal digital assistants.
The announcement includes various deals with different telecommunications companies and airports, made under the banner of Cisco Mobile Office, a campaign for wireless LANs (local area networks). The airport deals are at different stages, from a fully fledged paid-for service run by wireless provider Mobynet at Turkey's Ataturk Airport in Istanbul, where the wireless LAN was included when the airport was designed in 1999, to others that are still free trials.

base_container_specialized is NOT_A base_container. It offers same,
but type-safe, interface as base_container. It does so through some
simple casting (from T to derivedT). It also contains base_container,
so that you can get a reference to that if need be (operator const
this_base&). operator is const, to prevent e.g. calling insert with
base* or derived2*, as that would be bad, as others have shown. So
that gives you e.g.

void f0(base_container& c) { c.insert(new base); }
void f0const(const base_container&) {}
void f1(base_container_specialized&) {}
void f2(base_container_specialized&) {}

void test()
{
  base_container_specialized c1;
  c1.insert(new derived1); //ok
  c1.insert(new derived2); //bad
  c1.insert(new base);     //bad, don't want base among derived1
  c1.insert(new derived11);//ok
  const base* b = c1.get();//ok, derived1 IS_A base
  const derived1* d1 = c1.get();//ok
  const derived2* d2 = c1.get();//bad, derived1 !IS_A derived2
  f0const(c1);//ok, conversion operator used
  f0(c1);//bad, could insert base among derived1
  f1(c1);//ok, it's us
  f2(c1);//bad, f2 wants derived2 container

1818,"repeated ATA errors debian lennyFrom nobody Thu Sep  6 17:44:54 2018
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1

Hi all,

Recently a couple of new machines came to my hands, HP DL 180 G6 with 500Gb
SATA hard disk, and I tried to setup a 2-nodes ganeti cluster with debian
lenny.

Default 2-6-26 kernel does work without any issue.

I've done a fresh installation with nothing more than the basics (vim and
less ;) ) and after a aptitude install ganeti, editing xen-config.xsp and
grub xen options, upon restarting I get the following error on the screen:

Apr 15 13:24:56 virt8 kernel: [  297.381987] ata3.00: exception Emask 0x0

Apr 15 13:24:56 virt8 kernel: [  297.914235] ata3: EH complete

The installed versions are:
linux-image-2.6.26-1-xen-686
xen-hypervisor-3.2-1-i386
ganeti                              1.2.6-3+lenny2
ganeti-instance-debootstrap         0.5-1
drbd8-utils                         2:8.0.14-2+lenny1

I upgraded to kernel 2-6-26-2 to see whether it solved the issue without
success.
I also tried booting with clocksource=acpi_pm. I've also just tried
acpi=off, pci=nosmi, and nocpi as suggests the ata kernel website without
much success.

I've checked through internet and found the following:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=480317

It should be solved because hipervisor version 3.2 is higher than the one
solving the issue (3.0.3) unless redhat's version differ much from the
debian ones in minnor version....which i don't think.


Can anyone shed some light on this issue?

Thank you in advance!!

Samuel"

A national weekly

If you would like to make at least $500,000
every 4 to 5
months easily and comfortably, please read
the
following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and
AGAIN!!!
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION
BELOW AND
YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME
TRUE,
GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:

=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list
below =====

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE
NAME & NUMBER
OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING
and YOUR E-
MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose
name appears ON THAT LIST next to the
report. MAKE
SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON
YOUR
ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case
of any mail
problems.

=== When you place your order, make sure
you order each of
the 5 reports.  You will need all 5 reports so
that you can save
them on your  computer and resell them.
YOUR TOTAL
COST $5 X 5=$25.00.

Within a few days you will receive, vie e-
mail, each of the 5
reports from these 5 different individuals.
Save them on your
computer so they  will be accessible for you
to send to the
1,000's of people who will order them from
you. Also make a
floppy of these reports and keep them on
your desk in case
something happens to your computer.

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of
the people who
are listed next to each report, or their
sequence on the list, in
any way other than what is instructed
below in step '' 1
through 6 '' or you will loose the majority of
your profits.
Once you understand the way this works,
you will also see
how it does not work if you change it.
Remember, this
method has been tested, and if you alter, it
will NOT work !!!
People have tried to put their
friends/relatives names on all
five thinking they could get all the money.
But it does not
work this way. Believe us, we all have tried
to be greedy and
then nothing happened. So Do Not try to
change anything
other than what is instructed. Because if
you do, it will not
work for you.

Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!

1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports,
take this
advertisement and REMOVE the name &
address of the
person in REPORT # 5. This person has
made it through the
cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
2.... Move the name & address in
REPORT # 4 down TO
REPORT # 5.
3.... Move the name & address in
REPORT # 3 down TO
REPORT # 4.
4.... Move the name & address in
REPORT # 2 down TO
REPORT # 3.
5.... Move the name & address in
REPORT # 1 down TO
REPORT # 2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the
REPORT # 1
Position. PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy
every name &
address ACCURATELY!

===============================
=============

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified
list of names,
and save it on your computer. DO NOT
MAKE ANY OTHER
CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case if
you loose any data.
To assist you with marketing your business
on the internet, the
5 reports you purchase will provide you with
invaluable
marketing information which includes how
to send bulk e-
mails legally, where to find thousands of
free classified ads
and much more. There are 2 Primary
methods to get this
venture going: METHOD # 1: BY
SENDING BULK E-MAIL
LEGALLY

===============================
=============

Let's say that you decide to start small, just
to see how it goes,
and we will assume You and those
involved send out only
5,000 e-mails each.  Let's also assume that
the mailing receive
only a 0.2% response (the response could
be much better but
lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many
people will send out
hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of
only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out
only 5,000 e-
mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only
10 orders for report #
1. Those 10 people responded by sending
out 5,000 e-mail
each for a total of 50,000. Out of those
50,000 e-mails only
0.2% responded with orders.
That's=100 people responded and ordered
Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails
each for a total of
500,000 e-mails.  The 0.2% response to
that is 1000 orders for
Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails
each for a total of 5
million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response
to that is 10,000
orders for report #4.  Those 10,000 people
send out 5,000 e-
mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50
million) e-mails. The
0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for
Report  # 5.
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5
EACH=$500,000.00
(half million).

Your total income in this example is: 1.....
$50 + 2..... $500 +
3.....$5,000 + 4 . $50,000 + 5..... $500,000
....... Grand
Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL
& PAPER AND
FIGUREOUT THE WORST POSSIBLE
RESPONSES AND
NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT,
YOU WILL
STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY !

===============================
=============

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS
ASSUMING ONLY 10
PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU
MAILED TO.
Dare to think for a moment what would
happen if everyone or
half or even one 4th of those people mailed
100,000e-mails
each or more? There are over 150 million
people on the
Internet worldwide and counting. Believe
me, many people
will do just that, and more! METHOD # 2 :
BY PLACING
FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

===============================
=============

Disclaimer: Your earnings and results are highly dependent on your
individual efforts and results. This web page constitutes no guarantees
of any income, whether stated nor implied. Any earnings projections
shown on this website are for example and educational purposes only.
Actual results will vary according to each individual member's activity. In
general, the more you work the plan the better your results.



Advertising on the net is very very
inexpensive and there are
hundreds of FREE places to advertise.
Placing a lot of free ads
on the Internet will easily get a larger
response. We strongly
suggest you start with Method # 1 and
METHOD # 2 as you
go along. For every $5 you receive, all you
must do is e-mail
them the Report they ordered. That's it.
Always provide same
day service on all orders. This will
guarantee that the e-mail
they send out, with your name and address
on it, will be
prompt because they can not advertise until
they receive the
report.

=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS
============

ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS
NUMBER & NAME
ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S.
CURRENCY) for
each Report. Checks NOT
accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed
by wrapping it in at
least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those
sheets of paper, Write
the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report
you are ordering,
YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name
and postal
address.

$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS
GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your
success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders
for Report #1
within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails
until you do.

=== After you have received 10 orders, 2
to 3 weeks after that
you should receive 100 orders or more for
REPORT # 2. If
you did not, continue advertising or sending
e-mails until you
do.

=== Once you have received 100 or more
orders for Report #
2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system
is already working
for you, and the cash will continue to roll in !
THIS IS
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on
the list, you are
placed in front of a Different report. You can
KEEP TRACK
of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are
ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO
GENERATE MORE
INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-
MAILS AND
START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.

""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I
live in Chicago. I
am an accountant with a major U.S.
Corporation and I make
pretty good money. When I received this
program I grumbled
to Jody about receiving ''junk mail''. I made
fun of the whole
thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and
percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't
work. Jody totally
ignored my supposed intelligence and few
days later she
jumped in with both feet. I made merciless
fun of her, and was
ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her
when the thing didn't
work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3
weeks she had
received 50 responses. Within the next 45
days she had
received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all
cash! I was
shocked. I have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.

''Not being the gambling type, it took me
several weeks to
make up my mind to participate in this plan.
But conservative
that I am, I decided that the initial
investment was so little that
there was just no way that I wouldn't get
enough orders to at
least get my money back''. '' I  was
surprised when I found my
medium size post office box  crammed with
orders. I made
$319,210.00in the first 12 weeks.  The nice
thing about this
deal is that it does not matter where 
people live. There simply
isn't a better investment with a faster return
and so big."" Dan
Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada

''I had received this program before. I
deleted it, but later I
wondered if I should have given it a try. Of
course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so
I had to wait until I
was e-mailed again by someone
else.........11 months passed
then it luckily came again...... I did not
delete this one! I made
more than $490,000 on my first try and all
the money came
within 22 weeks."" Susan De Suza, New
York, N.Y.

===============================
=============

''It really is a great opportunity to make
relatively easy money
with little cost to you. I followed the simple
instructions

carefully and within 10 days the money
started to come in. My
first month I made $20,560.00 and by the
end of third month
my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life
is beautiful, Thanks
to the internet."". Fred Dellaca, Westport,

I'm afraid rebal is quadratic-time in the # of msgs it shuffles around --
since it was only intended to move a few files around, it's dead simple.

An easy thing is to start the same way:  move all the files into a single
directory.  Then do random.shuffle() on an os.listdir() of that directory.
Then it's trivial to split the result into N slices, and move the files into
N other directories accordingly.

Looks great! One note: most ""image-only"" spam actually has some text (a few 
words at the top, a disclaimer at the end) so keep that in mind. The typical 
image spam that slips through SA seems to have a bit of text, one huge image, 
then a bit more.

===========

Who's the real monster?


It seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that
dares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too
strong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're
some sort of monsters, violent ones no less.

Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people
are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their
way.

Yeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.

The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and
improving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be
sure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move
forward.  How is that being monstrous?

Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's
perception of them?  If you haven't already, contact them and ask them how
they feel about this foolishness.

Dave deflects what he can't take the time to understand


It's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand something
they usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek
the help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off
and looking like fools.

What Dave does is just the opposite.

Posts a link to something he doesn't understand
Get's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it
Derides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it.
Expects others to do research for him
Abuses anyone who tries to help him
Pontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue
Realizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself
Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy
Tries making the educated people look like fools.
Sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.
Exposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.
Deflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1
His continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be
true.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have you
follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth
trying.

One reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  ""It's like that movie The
Poseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the
passengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know about
you but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.
The ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot.""

Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach
around.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would
good ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love, right?  To hell
with asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he
savages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing
all the trouble.

We've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking
amongst ourselves about it.  We're routing around you damaging behavoir.
That's where we're coming from.

If you have an example of how you've tried to help Dave, please drop us an
e-mail about it.  We'll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it
along to zaphod@egroups.com


 9/12/02; 10:13:11 AM - Discuss




Trying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...


The trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.

Another developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it's fundamentally
impossible:

His basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web
developers are doing a terrible job.

In the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that
people at other tables start whispering ""that guy is an idiot...""

The zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers.  If you've got a similar
tale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at: zaphod@egroups.com.

Aha! Some backing down by the whining one?


It would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that Dave's been trying on
his crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.

I'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.
Still have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for
time-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have
to prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A
busy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people
who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any
deal-stoppers.

Hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use
it!

The poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to be
dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So
with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their
content into totally unsupported garbage!!!

Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start
getting rejected!

Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter
fucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his
'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed
with his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should be
nice to him because he's still recovering?

Uh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking
fights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.  That's what years of your
abusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.

I'll be in SF at Seybold, leading a discussion on Web Services for
Publishing with people from Amazon, Apple, Google and Jake Savin of
UserLand. I may be able to update my Radio weblog, but only if there's
something really important to report. So best wishes for a happy and safe
9-11.
What kind of asshole wishes people a happy 9/11??!?!?!?!??!! Obviously
someone who doesn't have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy.

Yeow and we though we were harsh!


Wow, apparently Dave's sticking his neck out quite far these days.  Craig
Schamp practically keel-hauls him with this one.  He wraps it up with:

The man seems to show over and over that he's nothing more than a whining
buffoon

Give that man an honorary Zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring!

RSS 2.0: code name ""Hitler""


If Dave tries to steamroll RSS 2.0 through without formal community
consensus, here now we call it the ""Hitler"" release of 2.0.

""No objections""?  No, he means ""No objections I choose to hear.""

Dave is simply not listening.  People are objecting all over.

Luserland Attempts to Trademark ""RSS""


Dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any
BigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally
bankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.

So we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried
to patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application:

http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336

This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development
efforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS
1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.

Could Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!

Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others
to do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:

Tim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents. In the
spirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.
There's no way to route around them.

When's a Permalink not a Permalink?


When Dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! The permalink links to
nothing at that point. So apparently the ""perma-"" part in permalink is
permanent. For everyone except Dave. Too bad his little attempt at a
definition fails to mention this...!!!!!!!!!

They were the ruling class of a feudal, farming society for quite some
time; I believe there were more than a few issues there. Certainly, not
everyone in Tibet is as excited about the Dalai Lama as Hollywood
appears to be. [Not that the Chinese are much better rights-wise, but
they've actually built roads and such, which led to the creation of
merchant classes and the like that never existed under the Tibetans.]

2.2.9.3-1 was announced April 16, 2010, which I use. That is 7.5 months 
without activity. Depending on what the change is from 2.2.7 to 2.2.9 
that might be a big deal.

Asterisk in Debian/Lenny claims to be bristuffed, not? At least the
the Debian patch tracking system shows the bristuff-patches:

We have a QuadBRI-Card and recently needed support from Junghanns.net

Why was the ""bristuffed"" line removed? Debian/Etch did have that

After telling them Debian/Lenny IS bristuffed they said this

Indeed, I had repackaged a first version, but without fam support (not

I solved the overheating problems I had by using utilities
under Vista enabled to set the processor for Low Frequency
operation (as opposed to Dyamic Frequency Control), and to
select the power-saving mode.

One of the utilities was in a Toshiba folder under All
Programs, another was in the Vista utilities folder.  (Sorry
to be vague, I'm not keen to risk undoing my present success
to double-check. :-)

Vista reported that the OS would need to be rebooted
for the settings to take effect.

When I rebooted into Linux, I discovered that the
fan would speed up at temperatures of 80C.
Also, playing video no longer causes overheat
and shutdown.

Idle temperatures are way down in a reasonable range,
around 60C.

The laptop uses Insyde H2O BIOS, which provides
no facilities for setting power-related parameters.
Fan controls and other functions are reportedly 
available via the omnibook module. I have yet to test
this, and no immediate need, having dealt with the
biggest thorn.

I think keeping the number of middle letters consistent with the correct

Useful point. With cp you'd have to start over.

What are the disadvantages of rsync? E.g., doesn't it compress and
decompress everything, hence hogging the CPU and possibly slowing transfers?

please don't reply to messages to send a new topic to ilug.  those of

tcpd is host based filtering/auth.  so if the ip is dynamic, you can't
really use it.  however ftp supports user based auth - actually it kind
of requires a user, so just set up an account for that person.

I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  

Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila. It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away. 

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance. 

I need a profitable long-term investment plan with your company or you. Your terms, suggestions and ideas are required urgently. 

Expecting your prompt response. Also furnish me with your current E-mail address, Tel/Fax Numbers (Private) for a personal contact with you.

Production Mini-plants in mobile containers. Co-investment Program

=22...Science Network will supply to countries and developing regions the technology and the necessary support for the production in series of Mini-plants in mobile=20containers (40-foot). The Mini-plant system is designed in such a way that all the production machinery is fixed on the platform of the container, with all wiring,=20piping, and installation parts; that is to say, they are fully equipped... and the mini-plant is ready for production.=22

More than 700 portable production systems: Bakeries, Steel Nails, Welding Electrodes, Tire Retreading, Reinforcement Bar Bending for Construction Framework,=20Sheeting for Roofing, Ceilings and Fa=E7ades, Plated Drums, Aluminum Buckets, Injected Polypropylene Housewares, Pressed Melamine Items (Glasses, Cups,=20Plates, Mugs, etc.), Mufflers, Construction Electrically Welded Mesh, Plastic Bags and Packaging, Mobile units of medical assistance, Sanitary Material,=20Hypodermic Syringes, Hemostatic Clamps, etc.=20
Science Network has started a process of Co-investment for the installation of small Assembly plants to manufacture in series the Mini-plants of portable=20production on the site, region or country where they may be required. One of the most relevant features is the fact that these plants will be connected to the World=20Trade System (WTS) with access to more than 50 million raw materials, products and services and automatic transactions for world trade.

Because of financial reasons, involving cost and social impact, the right thing to do is to set up assembly plants in the same countries and regions, using local=20resources (labor, some equipment, etc.)

1341,"Strange behaviour: Scanner and NetbeansHi all

=46rom time to time I have to assess Flash projects, and to assist my =
marking a few years ago I wrote a program which uses a Scanner to open =
the .fla file and read it on a ""line by line"" basis.  Although this is =
really stretching what a Scanner should do, it has proven surprisingly =
useful over the years.

My original version of the software was written with an ""old"" Xcode =
style project using the now deprecated jam.  Recently I decided I needed =
to make some changes to it and I thought it would be a good move to =
transfer it to Netbeans --- and it didn't work!  The Scanner wouldn't =
read a .fla file when run from Netbeans, but it would when run from =
Xcode, using either a jam or ant type project.  It would also work if I =
navigated to the Netbeans ""dist"" folder and double clicked the jar =
directly. =20

The following code shows the problem:

      String fullFileName =3D ""/Users/boblang1/Desktop/xxx.fla"";
     =20
      try {
        Scanner in =3D new Scanner (new File (fullFileName));
        while (in.hasNextLine ()) {
          String line =3D in.nextLine ();
          System.out.println (line);
        }
      }
      catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println (""Exception reading file: "" + fullFileName);
        System.out.println (e);
      }

When run inside Xcode or by double clicking the jar, the Scanner reads =
the .fla file.  When run inside Netbeans, it appears to open the file =
but won't return any lines (the while loop terminates early).  There are =
no exceptions reported. =20

BTW, the problem only seems to happen with .fla files.  I can read .txt =
files quite successfully.

I'm running fully up to date Snow Leopard, with the latest developer =
preview Java. As far as I can tell, I don't have any older versions of =
Java on my computer.  All the versions in /System/Library appear to link =
to Java 1.6.=20

Any ideas?

Bob

The easy way is just to install whatever Microsoft or whatever OS you
have in mind:  It should overwrite the MBR.  Indeed, the problem is
usually _preventing_ this from happening, as Microsoft Corporation's
installers seem to forever be overwriting your MBRs when you least wish
it, without asking your permission.

Techs fall again with telecoms, Dow drops below 8K
The day after WorldCom Group filed for bankruptcy protection, telecom shares suffered and helped drag down the tech sector.

BellSouth stock tumbled 18.07 percent after it missed Wall Street's earnings target and offered a worse-than-expected outlook.  With shares of SBC Communications, Qwest Communications International, Sprint and AT&T also dropping, CNET's Tech index shed 48.86 points, or 5.3 percent, to 897.37. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 36.5 points, or 2.77 percent, to 1,282.55.

With a report raising questions about Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s role in the Enron fiasco, broader markets lost ground as well. After a see-saw session, the Dow Jones industrials ended down 234.7 points, or 2.93 percent, to 7,784.5. The S&P 500 slid 27.90 points, or 3.29 percent, to 819.85.















BellSouth posts lower second-quarter profits 
BellSouth Corp., the No. 3 U.S. local telephone company, on Monday posted lower second-quarter profits due to slack demand and turbulent economic conditions in North America and Latin America.

BellSouth, the dominant local telephone company in nine Southeastern states from Kentucky to Florida, said net income fell to 16 cents a share from 47 cents a year earlier. BELLSOUTH CORP 22.61 -18.11% 

WorldCom, BellSouth news adds to telecom gloom 
WorldCom Inc.'s bankruptcy filing is only the latest in a long line of sad news for a slumping telecom industry grappling with soft demand, falling earnings and worries about accounting.

And things are not likely to change any time soon, as signaled by BellSouth Corp.'s disappointing second-quarter earnings and downward revision to its full-year outlook, analysts and investors said on Monday.WORLDCOM INC-WORLDCOM TRCK STK 0.14 55.56% 

HP seeks Texas justice; Gateway dinged 
In separate court cases, a Florida jury dinged Gateway for sending phone calls to the wrong business, and a federal court in Houston issued an injunction barring Emachines from selling products that infringe on Hewlett-Packard patents.
A jury in Florida ruled last week that Gateway must pay $3.6 million for a typo in which it sent customers with a PC problem to an 800 number owned by Pensacola, Fla.-based Mo' Money Associates instead of the company's own complaint line, which had a similar number but with an 888 prefix.HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 12.00 -6.25%

Analyst Mark FitzGerald expects the chip equipment maker to meet his revenue and earnings estimates of $225 million and 10 cents per share when it reports second-quarter results after the market close. He anticipates earnings guidance for the current quarter of 15-20 cents per share. The stock could move a bit higher, but FitzGerald believes better data from end markets is needed for a sustained rally.

Tyco CFO's tenure seen ending as confidence wanes 
Tyco International Ltd.'s earnings release on Tuesday may very well be the last for Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz, whose tenure has been marred by his close association with the conglomerate's disgraced former chairman.
Named CFO in 1995, Swartz has been the chief defender of Tyco's accounting, which has drawn fire for being opaque and misleading.

I ran into a problem doing this a few years ago, where calling
-conformsToProtocol: would cause a hang when the protocol was 
implemented in a category.  That might be fixed by now, but be 
careful if you check conformance.

This might depends somewhat on the actual configuration.
I have been upgrading this machine since early KDE3 times, always using the=

same .kde directory and I can't remember having any problems.
Certainly not when upgrading from 4.3.4 to 4.4.3 the past weekend.

No offense or anything, but there's a difference between holding a
sign that doesn't agree with Bush and screaming at him.

My sole point, as far as the 1st Amendment goes is that there is more
to this game than just being an angry, liberal youth.  (Which is the
gross culmination of everyone's argument sofar)  The screaming isn't
the most effective method around.  I don't believe I argued that it
was.  But screaming is happening because the means to communicate to
the representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as the
people doing the screaming are concerned.   For the record, I don't
support the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin
Powell shout-down that was mentioned earlier).  I don't think that
this is what the 1st Amendment was implying.  These folks -do- have a
right to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by the
folks they elected in the first place.

My point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases
such as Mr. Nell.   He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts
we have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion.   He
has a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to the
representatives that are elected.   A sign is not a shout-out.

I think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original
thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming
dissenters to the mix.  I was mostly responding with my miffedness in
having broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the
policy reasons that might have contributed to it.   IN this case, the
screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from
the folks they need to speak with.   They're resorting to creative,
offensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply
due to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum.   The 'My
generation never did this ' is all BS.   THere's more to this story,
we just dont' know it all.

I hope this clarifies my position.   For the quick rehash:

Screaming != Free speech on all cases.
Dissent = Free speech, provided you follow what has been laid down by
the Supremes.

K?

Turning $300 Into $20,000

In Oklahoma, Craig
Talkington purchased a Tax Lien on a 5 acre parcel for
$300. The owner failed to pay the taxes and forfeited
the 5-acre parcel to Craig Talkington. A short time
later Craig sold that property to one of the neighbors
for $20,000. That's the kind of money that buys new
cars and sends young people to college. Craig didn't
stop at one deal. He later bought a tax lien for only
$17 on a ten acre track, the property owner failed to
pay the taxes, and Craig ended up the property, which
he sold for $4,000. I don't know how much money you
are making right now but these are the kinds of
profits that change peoples lives and solve financial
problems and make things a lot better.

1367,"Security update for Debian Testing - 2010-05-01This automatic mail gives an overview over security issues that were recently 
fixed in Debian Testing. The majority of fixed packages migrate to testing 
from unstable. If this would take too long, fixed packages are uploaded to the 
testing-security repository instead. It can also happen that vulnerable

is present in your /etc/apt/sources.list. Of course, you also need the line
pointing to your normal squeeze mirror. You can use

	aptitude update && aptitude dist-upgrade

to install the updates.

I don't know of any backported binaries, so you would have to compile it
yourself. That, however, would be a major undertaking, and presupposes
that the latest KDE4 even compiles against the versions of the various
libraries included in lenny.

An alternative is to upgrade to testing/unstable, but then you would no
longer have the uncomplicated life of a lenny user :-)

Or you could wait for the next stable release, or at least for the
freeze announcement.

apt-get upgrade tells and prompt you.
apt-get is no more worse than aptitude.

Thanks for the confirmation, Diederik.  I wonder which package to file a
bug report against?  The k3b package may in fact be easiest to request
that the sound files be packaged in .ogg format, but that only masks
that fact that something in the KDE sound stack is having an issue with
.wav files.

My system is configured to use the Phonon Xine Backend in Sound and Video 
Configuration.  Could that be the culprit and how can we test?

=09=09=09Dear Readers,
=09=09=09
Your ISP, if it's anything like mine, works like a very large
boat: It moves slowly, it turns slowly, and sometimes it leaks.
Take rogue wireless networks, for example. For many months now,
some mischievous entrepreneurs have been hacking into major ISP
networks and siphoning off bandwidth for neighborhood wireless
networks. Only now, months later, are broadband bigwigs doing
something about it. And what
about ISP hackers? Could they break into your service provider?
Probably. Thankfully, you can protect yourself against most of
these leaks. Let Dan Tynan, our ISP guru, show you how.

Is your ISP safe from hackers?

Surely, the folks who run your ISP have thought good and hard

Sorry, I can not help you in this. I just downloaded the tora code and
compiled it against my oracle sdk which is in the /opt/oracle dir. (I mean
I've put it there and setup all I need to use it thisway)

So you are asking me how I did manage to compile it in kde 3.5?

First you need the sdk. I've put it in each version dir respectively. This
is an extra package.

Also why would you convert something from rpm to deb, when you can go to the
vendor and download for free the real code?

I've downloaded and put all I need in /opt/oracle

ll /opt/oracle/

make
make install

that's it.

I have to admit that for me the biggest challenge was to download the
packages I need from the Oracle site.

I remember I've tried to debianize once but it failed and I gave up, because
I didn't have the time.

Sorry about that,
procmail is run by the qmail delivery agent to presort all mail
I get.
But anyway, I found an error message in procmail.log, which solved
the problem.
The following line in my delivery script seems to work fine now:

DISPLAY=:0.0 artsplay 

Thanks

Orders? I asked what problems you have, so that I can fix them. You

look at the bugs that I've posted in reply to other peoples' issues.
Go look at who is filing them. Oh, sorry, you might take that as an
order and get offended.

My name is Wayne Harrison and I would like to share a
genuine, NO RISK opportunity with you.

What I have to share with you is not like any other internet
opportunities you have seen before. It is first and foremost
a CONSUMER OPPORTUNITY.

It also offers you the ability to have a share of a
new Internet Mall to buy at wholesale for yourself
or to send others and make commissions on their
purchases.

Besides this, it also offers a unique networking program
using a principle we call ""REFERNET"" Marketing. This is no
""get rich quick"" scheme, but rather a credible
and realistic way to save money and gradually develop
what can become a large, recurring residual income.

What's the best thing about this opportunity?
You can ""try it before you buy it"". That's right.
You can join the DHS Club for FREE with no risk
or obligation. 

Make sure and check out the DHS Club's own ISP, ClubDepot.com.
You'll get Unlimited Internet Access for only $14.95 / month! Included
are 5 email addresses and 5 MB web space.

To get your free membership and to learn more about
the DHS Club and our exciting REFERNET Marketing
Program and Postlaunch, visit my web page at


http://letscreatebiz/whjoinfree  


Remember, you have nothing to lose and potentially a lot to gain!


Best Regards,

Wayne Harrison

That ought actually to work, if a computer were plugged into the USB

I believe you have misunderstood me. I mean that instead of *typing* the
errors out by long hand copy the error using the mouse and past it into
your email/bug report. You could instead use the ""script"" command. This
eliminates the problems which typing out errors can cause.=20

Hi,

First of all, sorry for not replying to your private email from last week,
but I really don't have a slight idea of what could be causing this!
- Is this with different DVDs or a single one?
- Is this using OSS or ALSA? Have you tried both?
- Is this using binariy packages or recompiling source ones?

I remember a user having trouble with a particular DVD ever since upgrading
libdvdcss to a recent version, but haven't heard the end of the story.

  TP> Does this mean you trained on about 1100 of each?

The total collections are 1100 messages.  I trained with 1100/5
messages.

I tried the ""Anthony"" stuff, but it didn't make any appreciable
difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.

Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word).
That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.

So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-
headers that my mail reader added:

class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):

    skip = {'received': 1,
            'date': 1,
            'x-from_': 1,
            }

    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
        for k, v in msg.items():
            k = k.lower()
            if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                continue
            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
                for t in tokenize_word(w):
                    yield ""%s:%s"" % (k, t)

This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
tests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
run that used the timtest header tokenizer.

It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
discriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is
that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
indicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
spam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
XEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).

One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from
people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often
start with stuff like:

> Dear Sir/Madam,
> 
> May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a
> solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly. I am old science student

I guess that reads a lot like spam :-(.

I used to install Japanese fonts via aptitude.  But I rather think that they

Previous News Releases and Announcements Their statements are set forth in italicized orange type; our replies are in black type. June 4, 1999- Sirs: The following text was located on a site written or placed by you or under your control: 
""DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti. However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation."" 
""A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s.

The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed."" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) 
The purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) 
Correction: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 
miles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the ""fraudulent assertions"" of two organizations, ...** 
(Comment: Just because the RMI government ""...has condemned the 'fraudulent assertions' ...of ...EnenKio..."", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) 
**...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** 
(Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don't even know what being a ""sister nation"" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and 
the same could be said for DOM. 
**...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, ""...an article in Agence France-Presse"" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an ""...investment scam..."". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn't anybody check sources anymore?) 
**The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** 
(Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no ""fraudulent claims"" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any ""..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of..."" nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the ""Kingdom of EnenKio"" in the early 1990s.** 
(Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) 
Correction: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the 
owner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** 
Correction: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made 
possible by Murjel's appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios' and the people's behalf. 
**The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the ""kingdom"" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an ""agreement""? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

June 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling 'EnenKio' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. 
""Fantasy Island"" -- ""Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers"" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: ""Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,"" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands."" 
http://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: ""Fantasy Island"", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the ""Melchizedek press release"" you cited, indicating that ""...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of ""the kingdom of EnenKio,..."". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. 
The Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore's rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is ""...another only-in- cyberspace country..."", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by 'Marshallese' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not 'cyberspace') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article.

June 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). ""Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek."" Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with ""**"") in color: 
**In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** 
Correction: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the 
northernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: ""Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory."" **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan's historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. 
The Author responds: ""I don't see much conflict between the two versions here."" 
**The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: ""I will note this."" **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island's independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. 
The Author responds: ""I will make the necessary corrections here."" **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** 
Correction: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios 
succeeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. 
The Author responds: ""I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore's Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell. I should be posting a revised version of the page in the next week or so."" (June 7, 1999)

June 1, 1999: News Release
Part One Background: 
On May 21, 1999, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands posted a ""press release"" on the Internet at: http://www.yokwe.net/mboard/newsinfo/thread.cgi?67,0\cf0 (discontinued as of 12/1/00). The author, ""Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary"", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said ""press release"" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called ""Press Release"": 
This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
The RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: » » exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). 
» » was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, 
Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. 
» » was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution 
of the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. » » has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek » » has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as 
- now quoting Mr. Biglar's statement - ""RMI geographical and political
boundaries."" 
» » exercises authorities founded upon prehistoric traditional and 
matriarchal ancestral rights and titles bestowed, under the sacred heritage of Marshallese customary law (reinforced by the RMI Constitution), upon the acknowledged Iroijlaplaps of the Northern Ratak atolls, whose authority is certainly not subject to scrutiny by Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands. » » has not subjugated, assigned or encumbered any of its political 
jurisdiction within its defined territorial boundaries of islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll to the government or people of the Dominion of Melchizedek or to any other entity, including the Republic of the Marshall Islands. 
Mr. Biglar is unequivocally cognizant that the Republic of the Marshall Islands: 
» » also exists as a sovereign state, defined by the Montevideo 
Convention (1933). 
» » was conceived as a separate state by (UN) foreign governments, 
which included the United States, China and the USSR. » » was also established under a public authority, the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, ratified in 1979 by its people. » » has no relations with EnenKio that allows RMI knowledge of anything that is not also public information and no such public information respecting relations with the Dominion of Melchizedek has ever been disseminated to harm the RMI to be condemned by Mr. Biglar. » » has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which was not incorporated into the RMI in 1979, nor subsequently incorporated by any act, law or mandate of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch thereof and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. » » exercises authorities founded upon the RMI Constitution, which does not incorporate nor authorize political jurisdiction over territorial boundaries that include the islands or seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll and any statement to the contrary is fraudulent, as in the instant matter. » » has refused to acknowledge the leadership of the Kingdom of 
EnenKio in their every attempt to get the RMI government to mitigate the suffering of people residing in the Ratak atolls, under jurisdiction of Iroijlaplap Hermios, and the RMI has rejected every suggestion to coordinate prospective relief efforts through the said Iroijlaplap Hermios. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is steadfastly advised that any unilateral statements or actions by the administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands which purport, seek or serve to diminish or question the credibility, existence or authority of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio in the conduct of its affairs of state, without legitimate authentication by a court of competent jurisdiction, are hereafter to be taken as deliberate acts of aggression upon the Monarch of the Kingdom, His Majesty King Remios, as Head of State, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and its people, and will be countered with appropriate responsive measures. 
Furthermore, in light of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands announcement concerning the Kingdom of EnenKio, your attention is respectfully directed to the following statement in the Preamble of the Constitution of the Marshall Islands, then you decide for yourself: 
""With this Constitution, we affirm our desire and right to live in peace and harmony, subscribing to the principles of democracy, sharing the aspirations of all other peoples for a free and peaceful world, and striving to do all we can to assist in achieving this goal."" On behalf of His Majesty King Remios, we, administrators of the Kingdom of EnenKio, have wholeheartedly agreed to pursue the same goal for a free and peaceful world and have made no effort to the contrary.

News Release, Part Two, June 1, 1999
Part Two Background: 
The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, 1998 (click on reference # 2 below) released by the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, U.S. Department of State, Washington DC, February 1999, states as follows: 
""Where Are OFCs Located? 
[Paragraph 4] Thus, it is now possible for an enterprising jurisdiction anywhere in the world to establish itself as an emerging OFC. The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more ""remote"" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice."" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. 
The unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. 
Furthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of ""ethnic cleansing"" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less. For further information and links to documents, see: EnenKio Documents http://www.state.gov/www/global/narcotics_law/1998_narc_report/ml_intro.html http://www.state.gov/www/global/narcotics_law/1998_narc_report/index.html March 16, 1999: News Release 
The impact of the passing on December 10 of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, First Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak Atolls of the Marshall Islands, beloved husband and father, was felt throughout the society.  Flags were flown at half mast for a week 
in the Marshalls and for a a month at EnenKio Consulates around the world.  His remains were interred in a remote site reserved for the highest ranking chiefs, according to Marshallese custom.   His Majesty King Remios Hermios 
Second Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio He was succeeded to the throne by his younger brother, Remios, who will formally accept the staff of authority as Second Monarch, titular Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio in ceremonies being planned.  His 
Majesty Remios Hermios was a retired educator in the Marshalls and maintains a home in the Ratak Atolls. His successor is designated to be his brother, HRH Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios. For further information, contact the State Secretary back on the home page. SKIP TO NEXT FILE TOP OF PAGE 
March 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A ""State of War"" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.  The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in ""taking possession"" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.  The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.  Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.  Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the ""'State of War', a Declaration"" and broadcast it to the world.  The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.  It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.  While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.  The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.  Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.  The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. 
While the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.  The refusal of 
the U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.  Your understanding is appreciated.

December 19, 1998: News Release 
Subject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio 
The government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace.

July 14, 1998: Communiqué to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against ""fraudulent claims"". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual ""state of war"" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. 
The Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) ""asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries..."" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People's venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d'être is clearly mandated in the Preamble to 
the Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org 
Referencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled ""Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,"" of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom's web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. 
The published statement, ""The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain..."", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not ""created"" by Robert Moore and he is not a ""Honolulu-based attorney."" HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. ""Enenkio"" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. ""Wake"" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers.

May 4, 1997: News Release 
Subject: Issuance of Gold Stamps 
The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official ""First Day of Issue"" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. 
BACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in ""exile"". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. 
A NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to ""Wake"" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. 
""STATE OF WAR"" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual ""state of war"" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. 
CLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the ""state of war"" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace.

March 31, 1997: News Release 
An official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: ""A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES."" This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. 
This latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. 
The land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by ""Western explorers"" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. 
However, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its ""ownership"" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the ""natives"" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more ""hospitable"" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. 
Upon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, ""yields to the recognition that a State of War"" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. ""ownership"" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: » » ""...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable 
accord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR..."". » » ""If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens."" 
» » ""...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and
every 
action of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone..."" 
» » ""...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior » » ""...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay."" » » That the ""...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process..."". 
The government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations.

February 6, 1995: News Release 
On behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll, titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year's Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; 
2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the ""star wars"" program, I am led to believe. 
An emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army's so-called ""no significant impact"" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. 
On March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. 
Documents and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. 
Request for Media Response: 
The thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of ""world leadership""? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: 
1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) 
2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was ""decommissioned"" after the so-called ""processing"" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). 
3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. 
4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king's claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. 
5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) 
6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) 
Parting Shot: 
What truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western ""civilized"" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of ""manifest destiny"" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at ""fixing up the world"". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry.

November 21, 1994: News Release 
In a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. 
The legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. 
While putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. 
Eneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King's behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King's assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: ""Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island"" and stated: ""Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control"". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. 
Since 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: » » Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was ""decommissioned"" more than a decade ago. 
» » In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed 
Theater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. » » Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. » » A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since ""formal"" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese ""natural"" rights, including those of ownership and use of land.

I have one that uses dist to send stuff from my work mail to my 
home mail.  The binding looks like this:

set {bindings(key,HD_Dist_Silently -form distcomps.to-me)} 

The ""HD_Dist_Silently"" is a hacked up version of the proc that 
does dist in exmh and is pasted in below.  It's getting old and 
probably should be ""resynced"" with the current code.  But it 
still works (on a relatively recent CVS copy of exmh)

It's also possible that there's an easier way but I hacked this 
together quickly a year or more ago and when it worked I moved 
on to other tasks.

--Hal

proc HD_Dist_Silently { args } {

    global exmh msg
    set exmh(ctype) {dist}

1590,"Cost-Effective MLM/Bizop Phone-Screened Leads
Hello, 
Premium Phone Qualified 
Business Opportunity Leads
If you're spending money marketing a Business Opportunity or MLM,
you will definitely be interested in 
what we have to offer you. 


You're tired of blindly spending money for leads and not having 
any idea what kind of response you'll get from it.&nbsp; Sometimes
calling 100 people without one single signup!&nbsp; Sometimes 
talking to people who have been bombarded by bizop pitches
to the point of them hanging up when you call!&nbsp; (Leads oversold)
We're here to help! 
We'll get you qualified leads for your MLM or Business Opportunity. 
Period. 
No qualifiers, no conditions, no nonsense. 
We'll do it quickly, and professionally. 
And we won't ask you for a single dime without guaranteeing results!

Here's How We Generate Our Leads...
- All of these Leads are generated IN-HOUSE!
- One source we use for Lead-generation is a Business Opportunity
Seeker Lead List of people who have requested info. about making 
extra income from home by either filling out an online questionnaire,
or responding to an email ad, classified ad, postcard, etc.,.
- The other source we use is an Automated Call Center.
We have computerized software that dials up LOCAL residents,
plays a recorded message asking them if they're interested in
making money from home.&nbsp; If they are, the system records their
name and phone number for us to CALL BACK AND QUALIFY.
- The prospects that come from either of the above sources are then
PHONE INTERVIEWED BY US, here in our offices and the following 
info. is asked (after confirming their desire to find an opportunity):
Name:
Email:
Phone:
Best time to call:
State:
Reason they want to work from home!:
How much they want to make per month:
How much time they can commit per week:
How much money they have available for startup:
If they see an opportunity, how soon they would get started:
We'll close by telling them they'll be contacted by no
more than 3 or 4 people regarding different opportunities.
- Then the Leads are submitted to a website we set up for you, 
from which the results are then forwarded to you by email.
- This way, you get the Leads fresh, and in *real-time* 
(only minutes old).&nbsp; Never more than 24 hours old.&nbsp; Guaranteed!
- We GUARANTEE that you'll receive AT LEAST a valid Name, 
Phone Number and the Time-Date Stamp corresponding to when
the Lead was generated!&nbsp; However, almost ALL leads will have
ALL of the information asked above.

Benefits of our Phone Qualified Lead Generation System:
1. They will be Extremely Qualified due to the nature of the 
qualifying questions that will be asked (above).
2. They are Super-Fresh!&nbsp; Delivered in Real-Time only moments 
after they are contacted and qualified!&nbsp; (Not 30-120 days old)
3. They're Targeted.&nbsp; Each Lead we generate originates from a
targeted list of business opportunity seekers.
4. They're Highly Receptive!&nbsp; Receptivity is very, very high 
because they aren't bombarded by tons of people pitching 
them on opportunities!&nbsp; Also they'll remember speaking to 
someone over the phone.&nbsp; Especially since we tell them to 
expect your call!
5. No &quot;feast or famine&quot; activity.&nbsp; Leads will be coming in 
regularly.&nbsp; You dictate the flow!
6. No more cold calls!&nbsp; We tell your prospects you'll be calling.
7. You can *personalize* your approach with the info. you 
get with each Lead!
8. Save Time.&nbsp; Naturally, better Leads means less calls to get a sale.
9. Lower &quot;burnout&quot; factor.&nbsp; Calling red-hot Leads makes it easier 
to pick up the phone, day in and day out.
10. You can sort your Leads based on their responses and call the
hottest ones first.
11. You can get new reps started quicker using these Leads due 
to higher closing ratios.&nbsp; Of course, this builds faster and stronger 
momentum, and skyrockets &quot;new rep retention&quot; as a result of 
&quot;quick successes&quot;.
12. The Leads will be uniform - almost all leads will have the info. 
indicated above. (All leads will have valid phone numbers.)
13. They're double-qualified because to generate the Lead, 
a list of previous business opportunity seekers is used.
14. Excellent control of the flow of Leads coming through.
If you've been trying to run things too long without a steady flow of high
quality leads, call us NOW to get things in motion.&nbsp; Just let us know 
what program you want to advertise and we'll create a customized 
lead-generation campaign for you. 
Since your need to get business moving has probably never been 
more critical than it is today, why not call us NOW!
These are fresh, highly qualified leads because these people aren't 
just responding to some &quot;Generic Business Opportunity&quot; ad, they're 
contacted over the phone specifically for YOUR company!&nbsp; And we 
forward you the leads within minutes of the lead being generated - not 
days, weeks, or months!

So did my build if the original source is what you were mentioning ;-)
One drawback : They changed from pspell to aspell apparently, and it
requires aspell >= 0.50 which isn't even in Rawhide, so spell checking is
disabled for now until I take a decision about it :-/

If I build recent aspell packages, they may not be upgraded when ungrating
to the next Red Hat Linux release (the final version of the limbos and
(null) betas), which is maybe not really desired. I'll probably test and
see...

PS: The spec file was massively updated and the --with / --without options
that can be used to rebuild the source packages are now listed in the

I think you should pick up a book that covers MVC in the iPhone world.
""Beginning iPhone 3 Development"" by Dave Mark and JeffLaMarche is

That may be worthwhile.  Even if you had retained your 2002-era BNR
knowledge, the prevailing use of framework-provided view controllers
in UIKit is a pretty significant change with lots of interesting (and
mostly very positive) consequences.  Even some Cocoa old-timers had a
hard time grasping it at first--I'm living proof!  That being said, I
don't know if BNR is covering a lot of iPhone material now (though I
assume that's the case) or if they're still more Mac-focused, so check
first.

Ananova 
Wednesday December 4, 2002 11:07 AM
An investigation has been launched into the death of a passenger who tried
to ""surf"" on a Tube train.
The passenger, a man in his mid 20s, died in the incident at Chalk Farm
station on the Northern Line on Monday night.
Witnesses have reported seeing the man trying to hang on to the train as it
left the north London station.
There is also a suggestion that he may have been waving at friends in the
train.
The man died when he struck the wall at the beginning of the tunnel at the
end of the platform.
""We think he may have been trying to jump on to the side of the train. It's
not quite clear what happened,"" said a London Underground spokeswoman.
The incident was being investigated by both LU and British Transport Police,
who today described the death as ""non-suspicious.""

Much as I would like to answer an unqualified ""yes"", I must admit: if 
you already code in a style that makes heavy use of GOTOs, coding in the 
same style with GOSUBs or function calls does not improve code. Much the 
same as when the manuals on ""modular coding"" said to write modules that 
would fit on a single sheet of computer paper, lots of coders proceeded 
to split their code into arbitrary 60-line chunks. :)

However, ""Go-to considered harmful"" points out that to analyse (==debug) 
code, you need to be able to tell what the point of execution is, and 
what the values of the variables are at that point. This is an easy(tm) 
job if the code uses assignment, if(), for() and functions, but not if 
it uses GOTO. (See http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd02xx/EWD215.PDF 
for the full letter).

Despite being one of Dijkstra's brain-damaged children who learned BASIC 
at an early age :) I never use GOTO anymore (or any of its bastard 
offspring like break, continue, fudged function calls with sleight of 
hand in the variables). My code is longer than it might be if I had used 
GOTO at a critical, handy point. However, code is a bit like networks - 
you always end up adding bits on where you didn't expect to - and the 
benefit is felt when another person (like myself but in three months 
time) is modifying or debugging it and doesn't have to go through the 
hassle of dealing with the impact of the GOTO.

    said, citing sources close to the companies. 

    Apparel and handbags have their own conductivity, allowing an electrical

    In this way, people can exchange e-mail addresses, names and phone numbers

Sorry. I'm not thinking or communicating well. I'm using the vesa driver 
on the system, not nv. My brain was tracking back to an earlier 
experiment in which I was using other repositories. I use only main and 
security for Squeeze.

However, I have been showing xserver-xorg-video-nouveau in Squeeze main 
for a couple of days.

Too rich for my blood. By that I mean that nvidia-glx with this Quadro 
card has caused all sorts of odd breakages and unreliability issues in 
the DE. I have done enough experimenting with identical configurations 
of Xfce and Gnome on this system, with the only difference being use of 
different video drivers (vesa, nv, glx/restricted) under both Ubuntu and 
Debian to know that it's not my imagination. I'd rather have a reliable 
system than 3D, so glx is a no go for me. The vesa driver has been 
absolutely flawless, but quite slow, of course. The slowness has been 
worth it because absolutely nothing in the user interface has ever been 
broken since I went to vesa. I don't game, and I've just learned to be 
patient when switching workspaces.

;)

I'm looking forward to seeing if nouveau will be an improvement, 
performance-wise, without causing reliability issues.

I am, however, going to wait and install nouveau the easy way, once the 
upgrade to xserver-xorg-core becomes available in the repository. If 
this weren't my main system I might be tempted to experiment, but I just 
need this thing to keep working.

working perfectly on my Cyrix 333 box!).

Now, I desperately need some games, especially TuxKart and FlightGear, but I 
forever get stuck on a dependency: everything needs OpenGL. Querying the rpm 
database for OpenGL gets me nowhere fast. Can anyone point me in the right

Sorry for the question, but I've just switched from SuSE and I'm used to being

Hi Carlos Miranda Molina, please work on your message trimming 
technique, the OP was already hinted toward non-free by Camaleón earlier 
in this thread so I could only assume he was aware of the need to use 
non-free. I just mentioned that for me fglrx from Sid is working fine.
I am sorry if ""everyone"" is wrong, but your message trimming suggest I 
am ""everyone"" all by myself...
I like your prompt by the way.

554,"[ILUG] WE NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE TO INVEST IN YOUR COUNTRYDear Sir/Madam,

I am well confident of your capability to assist me in
a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties, ie
(me and you) I am also believing that you will not
expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about
to establish with you. I have decided to contact you
with greatest delight and personal respect.

Well, I am  VICTOR SANKOH, Son to Mr.FODAY
SANKOH
who was arrested by the ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE
months ago in my country Sierra Leone.
Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided
in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and
move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and
Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box
containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two
Million dollars).

This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond
by my FATHER and he have already
decided to use this money for future investment of
the family before his arrest.

Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these
documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my
father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a
Refugee by the Government of Cte d'Ivoire.

Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a
trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this
money from Cte d'Ivoire immediately for investment .
Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to
transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country or
another neaarby country where taxation will not
takegreat toll on the money?

(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my
travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for
theinvestment of this money?

(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable
business venture that would not require much technical
expertise in your country where part of this fund
willbe invested?

Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as
it will enable me to establish a stronger business
relationship with you hence I will like you to be the
general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a
Christian and I will please, want you to handle this
transaction based on the trust I have established
on you.

For your assistance in this transaction, I have
decided to offer you 12% percent commission of the
total amount at the end of this business. The security
of this business is very important to me and as such,
I would like you to keep this business very
confidential. I shall be expecting your urgent reply.
Thank you and God bless you.

VICTOR SANKOH

Thanks for the great work Mathias but I would like to point out that this
list is fastly become the apt-rpm-list instead of the rpm-list. The
discussion concerning apt is overwhelming. Maybe another list is in order
for those having trouble with apt-rpm. apt-rpm-hotline@freshrpms.net ? :)

Though I think apt-rpm is a great tool, I don't use it and would like to
get back to talk of new packages and rpm building techniques.

1472,"Missing the PointURL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85471617
Date: Not supplied

A lot of people seem to be missing the point of Phoenix, as evidenced by the 
responses on Mozilla News[1] and MozillaZine[2]. Let me emphasize something 
here: if you think Mozilla's current UI is acceptable, then you are clearly not 
the target audience for Phoenix.

Here is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you.


- The link toolbar is: 


- critical to my day-to-day use 
- vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn't everybody use Bugzilla?
-  link what?



- The sidebar is 


- indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution 
- not cool enough, since i can't float and dock all my panels and have 
splitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML 
panels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... 
- a waste of real estate



- Form auto-fill 


- is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information 
first 
- should just happen automatically



- Downloads 


- should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! 
- should be clearly visible and understandable.



- Toolbars should 


- be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the 
window, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be 
able to edit existing buttons' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be 
able to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and 
context menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file 
system and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and 
mow my lawn and... 
- be customizable within reason



- Composer should 


- always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. 
Everywhere! 
- not be part of a Web browser.



- Mail should 


- be part of my browser program. Aren't they the same app? There is a 
difference? 
- be a separate application.




Now to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, 
you can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to 
the ""optional add-on"" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or 
mouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them 
yourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will 
facilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an 
alarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should 
automatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. 

Why? 

A layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become 
as complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The 
geek features aren't inflicted on you by default.

Finally, remember that Phoenix's UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an 
opportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the 
browser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the 
user interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions 
within Netscape.

I was using Knoppix and ClamAV to remove a virus for a friend when the

7% of the time.  They screw up half the time.

There isn't a big demand for ClamAV on the Debian partitions of a

Don't swallow too quickly what you have read about

we have any statistics on the poor man's divorce from

Granting your first two points, I'm skeptical about
the last. Do you see ANY signs that America specifically
or the west generally are suffering from lack of
innovation, vis-a-vis youth nations such as Iran? The
last I read, the third generation of the revolution all
(a) want to move to America, and (b) failing that, are
importing everything they can American.

Did you actually attempt to order the DSL? Large chunks of somerville have
advertised DSL service that can't actually be obtained. Excuses vary, from
""no available copper"" to ""full DSLAM"", but the folks I know who've wanted
DSL around here have all failed, ending up either with ATTBB, RCN or an
honest-to-god T1.

*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*
By Declan McCullagh 
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT
http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html 


*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that 
would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 
surveillance by police and spy agencies.*

A discussion draft  
released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 
Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the 
right to be anonymous online.

The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice 
 and Industry Canada 
, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step 
in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 
conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion 
draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in 
early 2003.

Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, 
Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 
combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting 
these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the 
Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty 
, which the country is in the 
process of considering.

If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the 
possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet 
providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and 
permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden 
electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In 
most circumstances, a court order would be required for government 
agents to conduct Internet monitoring.

Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of 
Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have 
endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 
, which has 
drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. 
Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted 
, 
or ratified, the treaty.

Michael Geist , a professor at the 
University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the 
justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems 
weak.

""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the 
changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 
make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing 
argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, 
make that case.""

Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new 
powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant 
number of cases where police have run into problems.""

Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 
compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 
their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention 
orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
, but it 
applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.

""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and 
Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 
capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 
security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be 
responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.

Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center 
 (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says 
the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their 
proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not 
just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals 
only with computer data."" EPIC opposes 
 
the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and 
does not adequately respect privacy rights.

Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs 
of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with 
personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The 
implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 
providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" 
the draft says.

Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an 
activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea.""

""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous 
mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet 
anonymously,"" Hosein said.

A representative for George Radwanski 
, Canada's privacy commissioner, said 
the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on 
the paper as it stands.""

Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca 
 no later than Nov. 15."
1203,"Facts about sex.
Forwarded-by: Flower

Did you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is
sexually active or not?

1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when woman
   make love they produce more of the hormone estrogen, which makes
   hair shiny and skin smooth.

2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering
   dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses
   the pores and makes your skin glow.

3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that
   romantic dinner.

4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches
   and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable
   than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!

5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body
   endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and
   leaving you with a feeling of well-being.

6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually
   active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called
   pheromones.  These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!

7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE
   EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.

8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages
   saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid
   that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.

9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release
   the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.

10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national
    antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.

ENJOY SEX!"

If you are asking what I think you are asking, as in which files would you
need to restore your system in the event that you lose your apt and dpkg
databases, then I do the following:

/var/backups
/var/cache/apt (less /var/cache/apt/archives)
/var/lib/apt
/var/lib/dpkg

This will give you enough that apt-get update, etc works. Now the rules have
probably changed if you use aptitude as I believe it creates/uses a
different database.

Adding -r to the sort options, and piping through head instead,
might be a better idea. tail needs to read teh whole buffer, head
only reads the first n lines.

 from the Hard Disk Upgrade Mini HOWTO :

8. Prepare LILO to boot the new disk

   (Thanks to Rick Masters for helping with this.)

   We're  assuming  that LILO is installed on the hard disk's Master Boot
   Record (MBR); this seems to be the most common configuration. You want
   to  install  LILO  on  what's  presently the second hard disk but will
   become the first hard disk.

   Edit the file /new-disk/etc/lilo.conf as follows:

        disk=/dev/hdb bios=0x80       # Tell LILO to treat the second
                                      # disk as if it were the first

This is what I found too.  The IW add-on ""tor button"" configuration 
located at

 Preferences/ Proxy Settings

lists 2 options:

(a) Use the recommended proxy settings for my version of Firefox (and a 
checkbox is marked next to the only sub-option ""Use Polipo"" by default) or
(b) Use custom proxy settings

Hand on heart I could not say when this change took place as I haven't 
been using IW + tor + privoxy for a while, so this came as quite a 
surprise.  There was a recent update to tor though, IIRC, so it may well 
have been during that.

Dear Grant Seeker,
In a moment, I'll tell you
exactly HOW &amp; WHERE to get Grants. This MONEY has to
be given away, WHY not to YOU?

You may be thinking, ""How
can I get some of this Free Grants Money""

Maybe you think it's impossible
to get free money?

Let me tell you it's not
impossible! It's a fact, ordinary people and businesses all across the
United States are receiving millions of dollars from these Government and
Private Foundation's everyday.

Who Can Apply?

ANYONE can apply
for a Grant from 18 years old and up!

Grants from $500.00 to $50,000.00
are possible! GRANTS don't have to be paid back,
EVER! Claim
your slice of the FREE American Pie.

This money is not a loan,
Trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.
These Government Agencies don't have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do.

You decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the Government
Agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
This money is non taxable &amp; interest free.

None of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and U.S. citizen are entitled to this money.

There are currently over
1,400 Federal Programs, 24,000 State Programs, 30,000 Private Foundations
and 20,000 Scholarship Programs available.

This year over $30 Billion
Dollars In Free personal and business Government Grants Money will be given

Getting Business
Grants

Anyone thinking about going
into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-money-shop"" where FREE business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the Federal
Government.

It
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the United
States of America wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:

Over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in FREE
consulting and research grants.

With an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!

In
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.

Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.

What seems to work for me (and I agree, it's pretty confusing,
especially when you add 'man grub-set-default' to the mix) is to
include these three lines in menu.lst:

default	saved
# updatedefaultentry=true
# savedefault=true

I'm not quite certain which are necessary, but as I've said, this seems
to give me the behavior that I (and, IIUC, you) want.

  Tadpole's Secure Web Software Subsidiary Endeavors Technology Teams With Web
  Meetings Leader WebEx Communications
  To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During
  and Between Online Meetings

  Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for
  users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network

  ###

  Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure
  group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors
  Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx
  Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time
  and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class
  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.

  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this
  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around
  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience
  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how
  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between
  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple
  copies of constantly changing documents.

  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of
  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit
  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than
  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured
  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also
  essential.

  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for
  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be
  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be
  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules
  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at
  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,
  inside or outside company firewalls.

  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web
  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at
  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or
  ""present."" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across
  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents
  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx
  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,
  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.

  ""In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed
  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,"" says
  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. ""The powerful combination
  of Endeavors' Magi and WebEx's communications technologies will assist
  global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by
  maintaining teamwork momentum within and between Web meetings.""

  ""WebEx is transforming the way businesses use the Web for sales, marketing,
  training, support and product design,"" says David Farrington, vice president
  of corporate development at WebEx Communications. ""By integrating the
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created an offering that provides the
  best in synchronous and asynchronous communications.""

  About Magi
  Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms
  today's Web into a highly secure inter- and intra-enterprise collaboration
  network of files and web resources. For the first time, enterprises can
  implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for collaboration very rapidly and
  affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work
  practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming
  unsecured, ""read-only"" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent
  collaboration environments, through the use of such features as
  cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical
  interface, and universal name spaces generating ""follow me URLs"" for mobile
  professionals.

As you do not explicitly request the font to be used, I expected latex 
to choose some other font instead. Does it work if you run the command 
update-updmap and try again?

Otherwise, I have two suggestions:

1) Send and email to the debian-tex mailing list 
(). That list is the official 
maintainer address for texlive-base, according to 
().

2) Report the problem as a bug. ().

Before doing any of those two, you should rewrite the example document 
to be as small and simple as possible (still showing the problem) and 
perhaps also translate the text to English.

And my IBM Intellistation would lock up instantly .. now this is actually

>>>From my 25+ years in the playing field, IMHO the art of job-hunting

interview and into the engineer-to-engineer interview.  HR is not
being honest with you so there's no ethical quandry to be totally
honest with them: If they want experience numbers that would place you
in the OAK project, lead them to believe that you have ""something
roughly equivalent"" (ie ""it wasn't 5 years, but it was three intense
years with plenty of overtime"") -- they are playing a bluff in saying
/they/ know the job requirements so you're perfectly within poker
rules to bluff back to say you have it.

If you /don't/ have the requisite Right Stuff, the engineers can

often, their choice is based 90% on ""who can I work with"" and only
maybe 10% on ""how much/little will we have to tutor this candidate?""

1704,"Rats' intestines and pigs' teethURL: http://boingboing.net/#85497383
Date: Not supplied

This is the headline of the month, possibly the year: ""Doctors Grow Pig Teeth 
in Rat Intestines."" Do we even need to read the story to understand it? It's 
like a freaking _haiku_ of near-singularity, future-shocky wonderment! 

    U.S. doctors said on Thursday they have managed to grow living pig teeth in 
    rats, a feat of biotechnology that experts said could spark a dental 
    revolution. 

    Researchers at Boston's Forsyth Institute said their successful experiment 
    suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could one day allow a 
    person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one grown from his or her 
    own cells. 

    ""The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in 
    biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionize 
    dentistry,"" said Dominick DePaola, president and CEO of the institute that 
    focuses on oral and facial science.

Interesting.  So what is /badblocks/ for, and should it be removed 
in order to remove useless complexity?

While that's not a lot of training data, I picked random subsets of my
corpora and got much better behavior (this is rates.py output; f-p rate per
run in left column, f-n rate in right):

Another full run with another randomly chosen (but disjoint) 220 of each in
each set was much the same.  The score distribution is also quite sharp:

It's hard to say whether you need better ham or better spam, but I suspect
better spam .  18 of the 30 most powerful discriminators here were
HTML-related spam indicators; the top 10 overall were:

        '' 312 0.99
        '' 329 0.99
        'click' 334 0.99

        'python' 428 0.01
        'content-type:text/html' 454 0.99

The HTML tags come from non-multipart/alternative HTML messages, from which
HTML tags aren't stripped, and there are lots of these in my spam sets.

That doesn't account for it, though.  If I strip HTML tags out of those too,
the rates are only a little worse:

The 4th-strongest discriminator *still* finds another HTML clue, though!

The aptitude search ~Aunstable appears to just list all the packages in the

that gmail freezes when I try to past it in, and paste.debian.net tells me
that it is over 90kb and cannot be pasted."

Mmmm... how about specifying:

Under your /etc/X11/Xorg.conf ""Monitor"" section?

(make a backup copy of the original file before making any change)

Bob,

This guy's an idiot.

I design loads for systems with the 50 kV capacitors.  One of those has 864
of such capacitors and stores only 10 megajoules, which means 11 kilojoules
each.  They weigh 125 kg.

You need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked
maximizes that.

It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking
and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles.  You also need
voltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual
capacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them
arranged in series to boost the voltage.

Ignore him.  He's a waste of my time.

Since the energy you can pack into a capacitor is something like
1/2*C*(V^2), you want to design your system with the lowest voltage possible
to fully exploit that V^2 ;) So yea, a 42V system will only be useful for
accelerating insects, not cars. That must be why 40kV is standard not 42.
(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)

Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few
real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were
talking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the ""capactior is the
wrong choice"" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one,
it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady
discharge curve.

But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not
the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those
you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole
atoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with
a fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel,
and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.

Isn't it just basically a mixture of beaten egg and bacon (or pancetta, 
really)? You mix in the raw egg to the cooked pasta and the heat of the pasta 
cooks the egg. That's my understanding.

1788,"Re: Don't be too quick to assume that -XX:+UseCompressedOops is a
 good thingCan you post some details? I haven't done any serious benchmarking, but I haven't seen a scenario where something 'seemed' significantly slower, and in all cases I've tried (GUI applications and J2EE applications) the memory footprint was significantly smaller). I imagine a codebase that would not benefit much from compressed OOPs would be one relying primarily on manipulating primitive data types, but in that scenario I don't see how performance would be impacted. I'd love to see your data, and if anyone has some insight on the potential performance tradeoffs with compressed OOPs, please share!

476,"MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer calling exit?I'm running QuickTime on Windows (XP SP3) and have a reproducible way to
make MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer in a C++ program do something strange.
It looks like it's calling exit() or doing something equivalent, but I can't
say for sure.   What I do see is that immediately after calling
MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer, execution continues in the destructors of my
statically allocated objects.  If I replace the call to
MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer with a call to exit(), I see the same thing.

I'm using version 7.3 of the QuickTime SDK, but 

long version;
Gestalt(gestaltQuickTimeVersion,&version);

populates version with 0x07668000.  I can reproduce the same behavior with
version 7.1 of the QuickTime SDK, but Gestalt still returns the same thing
in this case.

The QuickTime-related things that happen before this are:

- QuickTime initializes normally
- QuickTime reads metadata from one aac file
- QuickTime reads metadata from a second aac file
- Quicktime reads the audio properties of an mp3 file
- and then I call MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer

The audio-related function calls are:

MovieAudioExtractionBegin
MovieAudioExtractionGetProperty(kQTPropertyClass_MovieAudioExtraction_Audio,
 
kQTMovieAudioExtractionAudioPropertyID_AudioStreamBasicDescription);
MovieAudioExtractionSetProperty(kQTPropertyClass_MovieAudioExtraction_Audio,
 
kQTMovieAudioExtractionAudioPropertyID_AudioStreamBasicDescription);

all of which work as expected (or at least I think they do).

And then

MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer

I can give more details about the API calls if necessary.  I think I'm
calling QuickTime correctly since it decodes audio successfully almost all
the time -- with this file and many others (i.e.
MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer returns normally).  I've had customers report
similar problems, but this is the first time I've been able to reproduce it
reliably myself.  Unfortunately it's with a complex program.  My attempts to
reproduce this with a simpler program have failed.  It seems to be
timing-related but I can't do better than that at the moment.

I'd love some help figuring out what's happening in
MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer, and even better some help making it go away.
If I need to report this in some more official way to Apple to make that
happen, please let me know.

Thanks much.

50 TIPS TO MAKE WINDOWS MORE USEFUL 
Do you have to deal with Windows on a daily basis? Might as well 
maximize your time with it. You'll find that some of these tips 
will apply to other operating systems, too. The world of computing 
isn't so mysterious once you understand how it works. With this 
GnomeTome, you'll begin to work faster - and smarter. 
Download Windows Productivity Tips now!  

I did a lot this weekend, but I didn't really get much done, 
ya know? My knees are killing me from hauling stuff out of 
the basement for storage up in the attic, but the pile only 
made it as far as the kitchen. Then I stripped and painted 
the floor where that collection of stuff was previously 
stored, and erected some shelving so I'd have room for more 
stuff. I woke up the next morning discover a very sick 
ferret, likely from the fumes that leeched into the next 
room over despite the ventilation I had setup to prevent the 
migration of bad air. So, I ended up dismantling the ferret 
cage to move it upstairs for a week or so until I'm sure 
it's safe. Thankfully, all critters are doing well now.

I also started in on replacing the cheapo rusted screws 
with stainless steel deck screws out back, but found that 
the ones I picked up are too weak, leaving me with stripped 
out heads and bent shafts. That project stopped after barely 
getting started. The front steps are also in need of rust-
proof screws, but they are made from much softer wood, so I 
moved the tools to the other side of the house. Two-thirds 
of the way through the first row, I found that the extra 
1/2"" on the screws I purchased was too much and I began 
running into the top of the old concrete steps underneath. 
Figures. Live and learn. 

Oh well, it was entirely too hot to work outside anyway. 
Back down to the basement I went to geek out instead. 
Roughly an hour into geekitude, I glanced over and realized 
it was 78.7 degrees in the basement and I was virtually 
stuck to my chair from the sweat. I shut off as much as I 
really could and still work on a couple of projects, but it 
didn't help the heat situation much. It was just too hot 
outside for the air conditioner to keep up with the added 
heat from the computers. That left me in need of a shower 
and with only the notebook in the living room for the 
balance of the weekend. I cleaned out a lot of ancient 
email, which was nice, but nothing really got accomplished 
otherwise. Boy, am I tired. And the weekend is so far away.

Hey, the second season of M*A*S*H comes out on DVD 
tomorrow! That should put me in better spirits. I could 
watch M*A*S*H for hours on end. In fact, I often do just 
that. The only kink is that the episodes don't play back-to-back 
from DVD. I'm going to play with AppleScript on the Mac 
to see if I can customize how the individual discs play. In 
theory, I should be able to make a disc play all the way 
through. If I succeed, I'll be sure to share the script 
technique in the AppleCore newsletter. Too bad I can't do that with a stand-alone DVD player.

See You in August,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Randy Nieland&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Slow File Save Dialog Boxes
Pointed out by Ian Hargreaves

http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;q321126

I've hated this one for a long time, and now we have a 
hotfix and a workaround, so take your pick as to which will 
work best. I often map drive letters to specific network 
shares, and if I happen to have a system turned off, I'll 
notice a significant delay when clicking the drop-down boxes 
in Open, Look In or Save In/As dialog boxes. Windows 2000 
attempts to reconnect to mapped resources before showing you 
the list, and depending on how many drives you have mapped 
and how many of those resources are unavailable, it can take 
eons just to save a file. A workaround is to use the My 
Network Places functionality instead of mapping drive 
letters. Fine for some, but I prefer having drive letters 
mapped for many things, being that I work at a command 
prompt quite a bit, and it's easier to navigate that way. 
Alternatively, a hotfix is now available, but you'll have to 
contact Microsoft to obtain the fix if that's the route you 
choose.

Customized 9x/ME Blue Screen Errors

http://www.vsres.com/blscrn/

We've all seen 'em. Those annoyingly incoherent blue 
screens indicating a system error of some sort, but provide 
no real help in solving the problem. If you're a programmer 
that has had to deal with error conditions produced by 
Windows 95/98/ME, then this might be a better way to handle 
them within your applications. Blue Screen v1.21 is an 
ActiveX control that uses the standard Windows system error 
functions, but provides a way to pass along text and 
response options you designate. Note that this is not 
functional on Windows NT/2000/XP, which handle system errors 
in an entirely different manner.

Gamers Beware of Intel 845G Chipset

http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4532
http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=4513

Discount the AMD hype and returned volley from Intel when 
reading up on all of this, but one thing is painfully clear. 
The Intel 845G chipset and P4 Celeron processors really 
don't provide an acceptable gaming experience. Not only is 
performance subject to ridicule, but compatibility is also 
looking to be a serious matter. Intel has never claimed that 
Celerons were high-end desktop processors, but they have 
typically provided a decent enough experience that they can 
make for acceptable machines for the more budget-minded 
consumer. The compatibility issues with this particular 
version of Celeron and the 845G chipset are something to 
watch out for. Once the Celeron is moved to the .13 micron 
core, I suspect the performance concern won't remain, but 
the 845G alone seems to have it's own problems without 
adding the Celeron misery. The lesson in knowing what 
hardware you're buying is what's important here.

Test Drive Compaq Servers

http://www.testdrive.compaq.com/

Compaq (Ok, HP) offers a set of servers running various 
*nix operating systems, as well as Oracle 9i, for test 
drive. Just register for an account and you can tinker 
around with Linux, FreeBSD or even Tru64 Unix running on an 
Alpha server, but without the hassle and expense of 
obtaining your own toys. I love the idea of having a pre-
configured environment that lets you kick the tires without 
causing any permanent damage.

Too Cool

http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,102779,00.asp

This was just too interesting not to mention. Water-cooled 
systems are all-the-rage among overclockers and those 
that seem to need bragging rights over their friends' computer 
systems. Hitachi is taking a chapter from that tome and 
applying the concept where it's truly needed - notebook 
computers. Believe me when I say that these suckers get very 
hot. I spend half my life with notebook planted on lap, and 
I have to put something between the two surfaces to avoid my 
own little heat stroke. Fans and the mini water cooling 
system Hitachi is implementing provide roughly the same heat 
mitigation efficiency, but without the noise. The concept of 
a water-cooled notebook sounds a little odd, but I would 
welcome the elimination of the turbine droning with open 
arms.

I may have a different version of ""sh"" than you do; the double quotes
around the backticks work for my ""sh"".

(In the more-than-you-really-wanted-to-know category, you're probably
safe without the double quotes.  The only reason I put them in is that
I have some pathologically-named folders, including folders whose
names contain spaces.  If all your folders have safe names, you don't
need special quoting.)

Techs gain on Intel, Motorola news
Although computer chip titan Intel posted lower-than-expected earnings, its upbeat forecast helped lift technology shares Wednesday.

Also boosting the sector was Motorola, which beat expectations for operating earnings and predicted a net profit in the last two quarters of the year. CNET's Tech index rose 14.46 points, or 1.41 percent, to 1,007.37, and the tech-laced Nasdaq composite index tacked on 21.97 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,397.23.

With aircraft maker Boeing beating the consensus Wall Street earnings estimate, the Dow Jones industrials increased 69.37 points, or 0.82 percent, to 8,542.48. The S&P 500 rose 5.08 points, or 0.56 percent, to 906.02.















Motorola Sees Profit Rebound 
CHICAGO - Wireless technology giant Motorola Inc. on Wednesday said it expects to bounce back to a net profit in the third and fourth quarters helped by aggressive cost cutting.

Motorola, a day after posting the largest quarterly loss in its history, said it expects to achieve earnings of about 2 cents a share in the third quarter and 10 cents in the fourth quarter. The estimated earnings for the second half of the year includes charges of about $215 million related to previously announced restructuring actions.

The world's second largest mobile phone maker has slashed its work force by more than a third from its peak of 150,000 in August 2000. It said last month it would cut another 7,000 jobs, bringing employment to 93,000 by mid-2003.

MOTOROLA, INC 15.15 4.27% 

Apple meets lowered expectations 
Apple Computer on Tuesday reported quarterly sales and earnings that matched analysts' lowered expectations as flat-panel iMac sales and sales to schools fell short of the company's initial hopes.
The company earned $32 million, or 9 cents per share, on revenue of $1.43 billion. In the same quarter a year ago, Apple earned $61 million, or 17 cents per share, on revenue of $1.48 billion

Analysts expected Apple to report earnings of 9 cents per share, according to First Call. Apple warned last month that sales would be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, down from an earlier estimate of $1.6 billion. The company said it expected earnings to be between 8 and 10 cents per share.

APPLE COMPUTER INC 15.63 -12.49% 

HP, EMC storage systems to work better together 
SAN FRANCISCO - Hewlett-Packard Co. and EMC Corp. said on Wednesday that they were opening up technology to each other in order to maker their storage systems work better together.

However, the deal will not include technology from Hitachi Data Systems, which makes the hardware for HP's high-end storage system, an HP spokesman said.

The deal follows close cooperation between storage heavyweight EMC and Compaq Computer Corp., which was acquired by HP in May.

HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 13.57 -4.84%

Investec Inc. stays bullish on Intel in report 7/17/02 
Analysts Eric Ross and Sam Chang reiterate a ""strong buy"" rating on the computer chip giant after it reports second-quarter earnings below the consensus Wall Street estimate. Ross and Chang expect a modest seasonal increase in demand in the second half of this year, with strength in consumer laptop buying. Calling Intel the premier semiconductor firm, they suggest the stock is a bargain.

AT&T names Dorman chairman, succeeding Armstrong 
NEW YORK - AT&T Corp. said on Wednesday its president, David Dorman, will succeed C. Michael Armstrong as chairman and chief executive officer when the nation's largest telephone company sells its cable-television business to Comcast Corp.

Dorman's appointment, which was widely expected, will become effective once the sale of AT&T Broadband closes later this year.

Yes, but if you ask for some non-void password, you need to send the

can do pretty much they want. So, why would you use a password?

  Welcome to this week's edition of DivX News, your weekly fix of
  information about what's hot and what's cool in the world of
  DivX video.

  Battle of the Planets in DivX Video!
  ------------------------------------
  
  One of the best things about DivX Video is the way it has opened
  up distribution possibilities for a lot of cool videos that may
  not otherwise be widely seen. From independent short films to cult
  movies with strong underground followings, a number of filmmakers
  and distributors are discovering that DivX Video provides a great
  way to get their content in front of new audiences.
  
  A perfect example of that phenomenon is the groundbreaking
  animated series ""Battle of the Planets"" from Sandy Frank
  Entertainment. Originally shown on American television in the late
  1970s, Battle of the Planets gained a popular following and was
  one of the forerunners of the wildly popular anime style. The
  series chronicled the adventures of a group of intergalactic
  adventurers as they battled evil and protected the universe from
  invaders. Beloved among anime fans, 70s nostalgia buffs, and
  anyone who enjoys great sci-fi animation, the series is the
  subject of a number of fan sites and discussion groups throughout
  the Internet. You can now re-live the adventures of the Battle of
  the Planets crew in high-quality DivX video. The classic episode
  ""Mammoth Shark Menace"" is currently featured on the DivX Showcase,
  and stay tuned for more news about future Battle of the Planets
  episodes to come.

* Watch ""Battle of the Planets 55: Mammoth Shark Menace"" in the
  DivX Showcase:
  


  Warcraft III Sets Sales Records
  -------------------------------

  A while ago, we told you that the highly anticipated game
  ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" from Blizzard Entertainment would
  feature DivX Video for cinematic cut scenes. In early July,
  Blizzard released ""Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos"" with
  record-setting results, shipping over 4.5 million copies to
  retailers. Coincidence? You be the judge. You can look forward to
  more announcements about DivX technology in some of your favorite
  games in the near future....

  Let's face it--if you don't have the latest Player skins, you're
  just not cool.

        The README is out of date. I'll try and remember to fix this
 (feel free to file a bug report to remind me). 

        I am not sure why the revision flag was not taking effect (I
 have not had time to look into the mails yet), but the +drm3 is coming
 from the kernel code (something is setting .localversions or the ilk).

About the only way I've heard of something like this working was back in
the Eighties, when management poster-child QuadGraphics used to have the
maxim ""you can't get promoted unless you teach someone your job"".

That might do the trick, though I don't know what happened to QuadGraphics...

1628,"[ILUG] Create a PAYCHECK with your COMPUTER and Enjoy Cheap ISP & shopping Discount.Hi -

( http://club.4tfox.com )

You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money.
Most of these emails are from people who are NOT making any money.
And they expect you to listen to them?

Enough.

If you want to make money with your computer, then you should
hook up with a group that is actually DOING it.  We are making
a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will
show YOU how to do the same thing.

This business is done completely by internet and email, and you
can even join for free to check it out first.  If you can send
an email, you can do this.  No special ""skills"" are required.

How much are we making?  Anywhere from $2000 to $9000 per month.
We are real people, and most of us work at this business part-time.
But keep in mind, we do WORK at it - I am not going to 
insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work,
and rake in the cash.  That kind of job does not exist.  But if
you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be
just the thing you are looking for.

This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is
done FOR you - it is all based on your effort.  But, as I said,
there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL -
meaning that it continues each month (and it tends to increase
each month also).

Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a
free member, at no cost, and no obligation to continue if you
decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still
have that ""burning desire"" to find an opportunity that will reward
them incredibly well, if they work at it.

To grab a FREE ID# and have more information, simply go to the 
 web address http://club.4tfox.com  and send me an email with following 
 information

""Send me a free membership!""

Be sure to include your:
1. First name
2. Last name
3. Email address (if different from above)

We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.

If you are not interested in tring to Earn Money,  :)
you are interested in the huge discount from the 140 Online Shops,
Very Cheap ISP package and many many more,

You can also go to the web address:

Just for the record mc has a nice directory

358,"Securing multiple virtual hostsI am trying to secure three of four virtual hostnames on our Apache server.
We are not taking credit card orders or user's personal information, but are
merely hoping to secure email and calendar web transactions for our users.
We are not running any secure applications on the root host.

I have been testing this week with CA, client, and host certificate
requests, certificates, and keys, and think I have a fairly good beginner's
grasp of the commands and command line options.


My questions are:

1.  Is it necessary to create a CA certificate for each of the secure
virtual hosts, or can one CA certificate for the root be used to sign each
of the keys for all three common names we are trying to secure?

2.  Even though the root host is not conducting secure transactions, am I
correct in configuring the server with a CACertificateFile in the main body
of httpsd.conf and then setting the CACertificateFile for each virtual host
in the  section of httpsd.conf?  This sort of assumes the
answer to 1. is  - you need a CA for each virtual host.

3.  Is it necessary to create a client certificate to distribute to our
users, or is it sufficient to have the CA certificate and a server
certificate for the virtual hosts?  Wouldn't a client certificate only be
necessary if we were trying to verify the client's identity?  Would that be
a good idea given our scenario?

Thanks in advance for your help.

I guess that requires something more in the way of budget then...  Given
that this monitor was serving as the single monitor for 4 boxen (via a
4-way vga KVM switch), I'd be looking at investing in 4 DVI cards along
with another KVM to suit while a VGA version _should_ just plug into
place.

Each day over One Million Dollars in Free
Government
Grants&nbsp; is given away to people just like you for a wide
variety of Business And Personal Needs
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dear Grant Seeker,
In a moment, I'll tell you
exactly HOW &amp; WHERE to get Grants. This MONEY has to
be given away, WHY not to YOU?

You may be thinking, ""How
can I get some of this Free Grants Money""

Maybe you think it's impossible
to get free money?

Let me tell you it's not
impossible! It's a fact, ordinary people and businesses all across the
United States are receiving millions of dollars from these Government and
Private Foundation's everyday.

Who Can Apply?

ANYONE can apply
for a Grant from 18 years old and up!

Grants from $500.00 to $50,000.00
are possible! GRANTS don't have to be paid back,
EVER! Claim
your slice of the FREE American Pie.

This money is not a loan,
Trying to get money through a conventional bank can be very time consuming
and requires a lot of paperwork, only to find out that you've been denied.
These Government Agencies don't have to operate under the same stringent
requirements that banks do.

You decide how much money
you need, as long as it's a lawful amount and meets with the Government
Agencies criteria, the money is yours to keep and never has to be repaid.
This money is non taxable &amp; interest free.

None of these programs require
a credit check, collateral, security deposits or co-signers, you can apply
even if you have a bankruptcy or bad credit, it doesn't matter, you as
a tax payer and U.S. citizen are entitled to this money.

There are currently over
1,400 Federal Programs, 24,000 State Programs, 30,000 Private Foundations
and 20,000 Scholarship Programs available.

This year over $30 Billion
Dollars In Free personal and business Government Grants Money will be given
away by Government Grants Agencies.


&nbsp;





Government Personal
and Business Grants Facts:
Over 20 Million People Get Government
Money Every Year:
1,000,000 entrepreneurs get money
to start or expand a business
4,000,000 people get money to invest
in real estate
6,000,000 people get money to go
to college
10,000,000 people get free help and
training for a better job





Getting Business
Grants

Anyone thinking about going
into business for themselves, or wanting to expand an existing business
should rush for the world's largest ""one-stop-money-shop"" where FREE business
grants to start or expand a business is being held for you by the Federal
Government.

It
sounds absolutely incredible that people living right here in the United
States of America wouldn't know that each year the world's largest source
of free business help delivers:

Over $30 billion dollars in free
business grants and low-interest loans;
over one-half trillion dollars in
procurement contracts; and
over $32 billion dollars in FREE
consulting and research grants.

With an economy that remains
unpredictable, and a need for even greater economic development on all
fronts, the federal government is more willing than it ever has been before
to give you the money you need to own your own business and become your
own boss!

In
spite of the perception that people should not look to the government for
help, the great government give-away programs have remained so incredibly
huge that if each of the approximately 8 million businesses applied for
an equal share, they would each receive over $70,000.

Most
people never apply for FREE Business Grants because they somehow feel it
isn't for them, feel there's too much red-tape, or simply don't know who
to contact.The fact is, however, that people from all walks of life do
receive FREE GRANTS MONEY and other benefits from the government, and you
should also.

Grants is so comprehensive, it provides you with direct access to practically
every source of FREE government grants money currently available.
If you're an American citizen
or resident, you are entitled to free grant money ranging from $500 to
$250,000 or more. If you are Black you have already qualified for 15 programs,
being Hispanic, you qualify for many programs. Being a Christian will get
you into 20 programs, there are also many other programs available for
different faiths, Jewish, Catholic. Not having any money, will get you
into over 30 programs, 550 programs if you are unemployed, or underemployed.
The list and sources are endless.

You Are Eligible! This money
is Absolutely Free and will be yours to use for any worthwhile purpose.

Did you know you can apply
for as many grants as you want?

It's true, For instance,
you could get a $65,000 grant to begin a weight loss business, get $8,800
in tuition to become a nurse or $35,000 to open up the day-care center,
you've always dreamed of owning. And then, go out and apply for a grant
to buy a home for you and your family. And once your new business starts
doing well you could go out and get another grant for expansion of your
business. The possibilities are endless.

Intel also had a similar device a couple of years ago (Netstructure).  They have, afaik, abandoned it.

Intel is still in the XML hardware game though.  On 8/19 they spun off a company named Tarari.   Tarari develops hardware to check the headers of IP packets. Tarari calls 
this Layer 7 processing (atop the OSI model).    From what I can tell, Tarari plans to combine virus scanning and XML acceleration into a single hardware device."

  | hmmm, I assume you're going to report this to the nmh folks?

Yes, I will, sometime, after I look at the nmh sources and see what
they have managed to break, and why.

But we really want exmh to operate with all the versions of nmh that
exist, don't we?   The patch to have exmh do the right thing, whether this
bug exists, or not, is trivial, so I'd suggest including it.

Patch follows ...

I have no idea why the sequences were being added after the message list
before, not that it should make any difference to nmh (or MH).   But since
I stopped doing that, the variable ""msgs"" isn't really needed any more,
rather than assigning $pick(msgs) to msgs, and then using $msgs the code
could just use $pick(msgs) where $msgs is now used.   This is just a
frill though, so I didn't change that.

Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today

Top Ten Most Important Things to Do Today
By Michael E. Angier

This is my list. They're the ones I've selected for my life at
present. Consider them suggestions for yourself--ideas to 
help you generate your own top ten list. By getting clear 
on and acting upon YOUR most important steps, you'll be 
moving toward and experiencing your highest and best.


1. Practice gratefulness. Reflect upon the things in my life for
which I'm grateful. If I appreciate more of what I have, I will
have even more to appreciate.

2. Write out my three most important goals and visualize 
how my life will be when I have achieved them. FEEL it. 
EXPERIENCE it in as much sensory detail as I can possibly 
imagine.

3. Take some action steps toward each of the three goals.

4. Exercise my body and monitor carefully what I eat and 
drink. Reduce fat and caloric intake while expending more 
calories. Eat only small amounts at one time.

5. Read something educational, inspirational or
entertaining--preferably all three.

6. Meditate. Empty my conscious mind and listen to the
Super-conscious.

7. Have fun doing something I love to do. Experience joy.

8. Write something--anything. If not an article or part of 
my book, then write in my journal.

9. Perform some act of kindness. Do a thoughtful, 
magnanimous thing--anonymously if possible.

10. Finish something. Do something I can call complete.

Bonus Step: Make something work better -- 
Practice ADS: Automate, Delegate and Systemize.

Last Weeks's Survey Results & Comments  (07/27/01)

 ~~~ Are you concerned about identity theft online? ~~~

yes   81%
no    19%

Comments:
~~~~~~~~~

No. This is a funny thing to me.  I hear about so many 
people being super scared to give out their SS#.  Well folks, 
I can get your SS# for 50 cents.  Give me a name and address 
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.  

We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and 
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.  They could do 
who knows what with the CC number.  I once had a person 
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy 
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that 
person (me) would have her account info and could write 
a check out for thousands of dollars.  I told her to just send 
it to me then and she said that was OK.  Then I asked her 
to tell me what the difference was between the original check 
and a fax copy.  I told her to ask her lawyer that too.  Never 
heard back from her.  

The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is 
available in many places.  Have a good day.
--  Terry    http://mysiteinc.com/tfn/lfi.html
~~~~~~~~~

Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However, 
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most 
importantly, never give any personal information at a site 
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar 
or a Veri secure sign or others. 

Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put 
in my credit information in each time instead of having 
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks 
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet 
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is 
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web 
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!
--  Catherine F.      http://www.catco.nexgenmall.com 
~~~~~~~~~

Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that 
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner 
was in a bad car accident.  I had a full service account.  
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address 
went unprotected.  A Russian stepped in; paid the fees; 
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com 
address to a porn shop.  Thus, I lost 4 years of building 
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place 
on 8 more.  This set me back about 4  months: I believe I 
lost a minimum of $50,000.  
 
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.  The first 
time I lost almost 4 months of work.  Now, I back up often 
enough to not to lose so much time.  This is also Internet 
theft.  These people are nothing but out and out criminals 
and should spend years behind bars.
 
Customers are well protected from credit card theft; 
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.  I sell only by 
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

I can get your SS# for 50 cents.&nbsp; Give me a name and address
and about 90% of the time I can get the number.
We are so worried about putting our credit card number on
the net, but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and
they take it out of our sight for 10 minutes.&nbsp; They could do
who knows what with the CC number.&nbsp; I once had a person
tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy
of her check to anyone (checks by fax) because then that
person (me) would have her account info and could write
a check out for thousands of dollars.&nbsp; I told her to just send
it to me then and she said that was OK.&nbsp; Then I asked her
to tell me what the difference was between the original check
and a fax copy.&nbsp; I told her to ask her lawyer that too.&nbsp;
Never
heard back from her.
The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info, it is
available in many places.&nbsp; Have a good day.

Yes. I believe that the risk is out there but minimal. However,
we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions. Most
importantly, never give any personal information at a site
that is not secure, always look for the lock in thetask bar
or a Veri secure sign or others.
Also, never leave your information stored at a site. I put
in my credit information in each time instead of having
an account in standing, a little more time but less risks
involved! Of course, I mostly shop at my own Internet
mall and I know how safe it is there, credit card info is
deleted in a matter of seconds. Overall, I believe the web
to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier!

Yes. I had phenomena for 6 weeks and did not realize that
my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner
was in a bad car accident.&nbsp; I had a full service account.
My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address
went unprotected.&nbsp; A Russian stepped in; paid the fees;
and, promptly assigned my www.SchoolOfGeomatics.com
address to a porn shop.&nbsp; Thus, I lost 4 years of building
up 1st place rankings on 12 Search Engines and 2nd place
on 8 more.&nbsp; This set me back about 4&nbsp; months: I believe I
lost a minimum of $50,000.
&nbsp;
I have also been hit with viruses about 10 times.&nbsp; The first
time I lost almost 4 months of work.&nbsp; Now, I back up often
enough to not to lose so much time.&nbsp; This is also Internet
theft.&nbsp; These people are nothing but out and out criminals
and should spend years behind bars.
&nbsp;
Customers are well protected from credit card theft;
however, merchants can lose a lot of money.&nbsp; I sell only by
purchase order and certified or registered company checks.

Hi Florian,

Back when I was running the WSMF shoutcast server these restrictions were
just being placed on netcasters. Most folks laughed it off. Now with the
license fees its not laughable anymore. If you pay the fee you are bound
to the restrictions, if you dont your running the criminal line.

I still run a stream up on live365. Its been playing the same 10 hour
block of Jean Shepard shows for the last year. I really should change them
up.

If I were going to do the old WSMF shoutcast now adays I would either
spend lots of time going over regulations to see what I can or cannot do
or I would just chuck the regs out and do what I want. Or I might write

In short yes. The more logic involved the longer
the CPU is executing it. I.E. there is more logic
executed (including NIC logic) when going down
to the metal than when using lo. So how much
logic is involved for each type of IPC (why
are you limiting yourself to sockets? there are
mutexes, shared mem, files, messages...). Anyway the
best IPC method to choose is dictated by the data
you want to communicate between the processes,
as the various IPC mechanisms are tuned for
various data types.

IBM are running a series comparing doze and Linux IPC mechanisms.
The socket (which references the others at the bottom) is here:
http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-rt6/?t=gr,Redhat=Sockets

The following in google gave useful info also:
""linux IPC mechanisms compared""

Including rsync?  I'd say that's the exact purpose of rsync.

Anyway, there are many filesystem comparison tools if one wants to do it 
""manually"", like dirdiff.  For file contents, just hash and re-hash.

Very interesting --- but

My quick googling reveals many USB drive enclosures for both ATA and SATA
but the marketers don't make mention of S.M.A.R.T . What is the brand of
your enclosure. I want to look for it, in particular, and see if it claims
the feature that you have discovered. Actually, on looking a little more
closely, I'm not seeing any case of a single enclosure that can be used
with both ATA and SATA. Do I read your post correctly - your enclosure can
contain either a SATA or an ATA, and work over USB? But SMART only works
when it is enclosing an ATA?

It looks not so normal to me.

But looking at Debian wiki for EEE systems it seems to be a known issue 
with power management:

***
http://wiki.debian.org/DebianEeePC/HowTo/Configure#Powermanagement

Power management

On some models, the battery info is not very precise (jumps from 10% to 
100%, no rate information, etc.). Apparently, this is normal. It appears 
that the userspace battery utilities expect the battery to report mAh, 
but in fact it reports percentage. This is either a bug in the battery 
firmware or a bug in the BIOS; it is known to be fixed with newer BIOS 
versions and kernels ≥ 2.6.25.

Well, I went hunting online and it is definitely possible to get

I've used dd to push a copy of a working system onto larger drives in the
past. So my misuse of the term ""migrate"" is me actually doing a copy of the
working system to a new, larger device and then zap the original.

I'd hoped there was a block by block way to do it so I didn't have to set
up the partitions & filesystems ahead of time but I suppose that part won't
be too painful.

The system is relatively idle during these types of surgeries because I
boot from a live CD so the data on disk isn't churning.

Thanks to all who responded, it gave me a lot to consider for this type of
project. Like doing proper diffs afterwards to make sure everything landed
on the new device properly!

Are you kidding? It was fucking BRILLIANT. Do you know what exposure that got
them? They sat perfectly so that the cameras could focus on the mildly 
exasperated Rumsfeld and their ""UN Inspections not war"" banner. That picture
will be dominating the news cycles in China, Iraq, Russia, Germany, and 
France, at least. For goodness sakes, you're arguing about it on FoRK. In 
politics by sound-bite, those two rude hags kicked ass and took names.

For the record, I don't think they even got arrested, which is a shame. It
is part of the game -- make an ass of yourself, get your point on the nightly
news, spend a couple days in the clink for disorderly.

895,"Postfix, SASL and LDAPDBHey guys,

I want to set up SASL authentication using LDAPDB, but it seems that
postfix connects to LDAP but doesn't send anything to it...

I try to authenticate using 'auth plain ', and I receive :

535 5.7.8 Error: authentication failed: authentication failure

Connection to LDAP works fine at the network level, but the only thing
that postfix send to Slapd (sniffed using tcpdump) is a ""UNBIND"" request.
Confirmed by the logs of slapd:

----
May 18 17:25:29 samchiel slapd[1431]: conn=35 fd=17 ACCEPT from
IP=127.0.0.1:57368 (IP=127.0.0.1:389)
May 18 17:25:29 samchiel slapd[1431]: conn=35 op=0 UNBIND
May 18 17:25:29 samchiel slapd[1431]: conn=35 fd=17 closed
----

Postfix says the following:

----
May 18 17:25:29 samchiel postfix/smtpd[12094]:  localhost[127.0.0.1]: 535
5.7.8 Error: authentication failed: authentication failure
----

So, I assumed there might be something wrong with my configuration. Since
I'm on Debian Squeeze (for testing purpose), I have a
/etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf that contains the configuration of ldapdb:

----
# cat /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf
pwcheck_method: auxprop
auxprop_plugin: ldapdb
mech_list: PLAIN LOGIN
ldapdb_uri: ldap://localhost
ldapdb_id: postfix
ldapdb_pw: ZZZZzzzzZZZZZZZ
ldapdb_mech: DIGEST-MD5 PLAIN LOGIN
----

and sasl directives in main.conf

----
# grep smtpd_sasl main.cf
smtpd_sasl_type = cyrus
smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtpd_sasl_path = smtpd
smtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
smtpd_sasl_local_domain = $mydomain
smtpd_sasl_authenticated_header = yes
----


Did I miss anything ? Any clue on why postfix doesn't send anything but an
UNBIND request to LDAP ?



Thanks,
Julien

Works just fine here:

$ nl /etc/fstab | sed -n '1,2p;4p'
     1  # /etc/fstab: static file system information.
     2  #
     4  proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0

     2  #
     4  proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0
0


So please give some more details about your system (version of Debian,
version of sed, etc.). Also please tell us what actually happens when
you try to run it.

1269,"Re: Fw: Re: When are we going to get. [making ALSA rpms]Thanks for this information.  I gave Alsa a try, couldn't figure out how
to enable digital out, although I'm sure if I put enough time into it,
could have gotten it working.  Also when playing mp3s in analog mode,
every time I switched between mp3s there was a bit of static.  Noticed a
new distribution geared towards audio applications, AGNULA
(http://www.agnula.org/) uses Alsa as well.  Seems though the latest
open source emu10k1 drivers (SBLive! 5.1) work fair enough.  Anyone else
experience these problems with Alsa?  Are there alot of people on this
list using Alsa?

Its a little confusing but you install rpms like
rpm -ivh packagename-0.1.1.rpm 
uninstalls must be done without the version info like
rpm -e packagename   ie: rpm -e sendmail or 
rpm -e sendmail-devel. 

give that a go and it should work np.

We don't know what's the issue with this site exactly. It looks like a
commercial showstopper not a limitation in flash or it look like it's a
commercial limitation, something I would not consider as flash problem. But
if the  guy says it's working in 32bit then it's probably a 64bit flash for
linux issue, for real ... strange things happen all the time.

Run xev from a terminal window. If you move the mouse cursor into the 
window that pops up, hold it still there and click the middle button, 
you should see something like this:

ButtonPress event, serial 26, synthetic NO, window 0x400001,
     root 0x381, subw 0x0, time 208302587, (103,133), root:(107,155),
     state 0x0, button 2, same_screen YES

ButtonRelease event, serial 26, synthetic NO, window 0x400001,
     root 0x381, subw 0x0, time 208302722, (103,133), root:(107,155),
     state 0x200, button 2, same_screen YES

If it says button 2, your X11 setup is okay. If not, please run this 
command and tell us the output:

   defaults read org.x.x11

If your xev run does give you button 2 events, then there is probably 
something wrong with your window manager setup.

   QUICKTIME
   Version 6.0
   File size: 402K
   License: Free
   Minimum requirements: Mac OS 8.6/9.x or Mac OS X

   The latest version of Apple's premiere media application
   supports the increasingly popular MPEG-4 codec for high-
   quality, highly compressed video, as well as modern formats
   such as AAC (Advanced Audio Codec) and JPEG 2000. It also
   provides skip protection, an enhanced user interface with a
   more intuitive and useful Favorites menu, new developer APIs,
   and other useful features such as support for Flash 5 files.

   CARTOON EDITOR
   Version: 1.2.1
   File size: 2.38MB
   License: Free
   Minimum requirements: Mac OS X

   Cartoon Editor won't turn you into a gifted cartoonist
   overnight. But what this graphic editor will do is make quick
   work of creating short QuickTime movies and animated GIFs--
   and for OS X freeware, it doesn't get much better than that.
   Cartoon Editor lets you draw or import JPEGs and GIFs, which
   you can then manipulate with a set of tools that lets you
   group, scale, duplicate, ghost, and all sorts of other useful
   cartoony things. The program's Java2D foundation allows for
   some surprisingly powerful features, like gradients,
   antialiasing, splining, and transparencies.

   data, meaning that you can calculate the appropriate moon
   phase for a particular date and identify topographical
   features on the moon using a built-in catalog of those that
   have been surveyed by astronomers and astronauts. This update
   incorporates improved help features and a few bug fixes.

It should be noted that the  --ghost option of automount will create
an appropriate ""ghost"" directory for the device's mount point. For the
above auto.master stanza you could use:
  /var/autofs/usb /etc/auto.usb --timeout=### --ghost

This can lead to a cluttered /var/autofs/usb directory, however,
unless you do some udev-based scripting to manage things on the fly.

The question I have is: what needs to be done/help needs to be provided to
make the system suck less? It's obviously a great idea, it just needs some
work...

By design. It only almost worked good.
Codewise it is replaced by the kfileplacesmodel, I'm sure one could
write a plasma widget around it quite easy if one wanted.

Before pressing ""Connect"" be sure your calculator is setup as described

Can you see the ""Awaiting Server Cmd."" message in calculator's display?

Port ""100""? What kind of port nomenclature is that? :-? 

I would expect ""/dev/ttyUSB0"" for an USB device or ""/dev/ttyS0"" for the 
first rs-232 port...

I think the application is crashing because cannot establish a connection 
with the device.

3. BE A SF.NET FOUNDRY GUIDE.
4. WORK FOR SOURCEFORGE.NET
5. SITE STATISTICS


0. INTRO

Hello SourceForge.net Users,

This week we've made a big announcement.  As you likely know, any
large dynamic website is powered by a database that funnels data to
the web servers serving data which ultimately gets sent to you.
These databases manage everything from user authentication, session
management, site searching, etc.  SourceForge.net is a database-
dependent website.

Today we have announced that we are moving SourceForge.net to DB2,
a powerful relational database by IBM.  We are doing this because
the site continues to grow at a rapid rate, with 700 new users and
70 new projects a day, and we need a database that can handle this
growth.  We feel that DB2 can do this for us, and IBM is giving us
the resources to make this transition successful.  You can read the
press release here:

http://www.vasoftware.com/news/press.php/2002/1070.html

How will this effect you?  In the first phase, you won't see much
difference other then the site will continue to grow and the
SourceForge.net team will be able to handle the growth.  In later
phases you will see new features on the site that take advantage of
the databases advanced capabilities.

Today our mail archives have been converted over.  The rest of the
site will make the migration to DB2 in the coming months.

If you have questions about this or any other aspect of the site,
please feel free to email me, pat@sourceforge.net.  I always
appreciate the feedback.

Thank you for your continued support of SourceForge.net and the
Open Source Community.

Pat-

Patrick McGovern
Director, SourceForge.net



1. INCREASED DOWNLOAD CAPACITY

SourceForge.net continues to grow, and it's appetite for bandwidth
is never-ending.  Every day SF.NET serves over 300,000 files to
ensure that developers and end-users within the Open Source
community can always obtain the software released by hosted
projects, SourceForge.net maintains a network of high-capacity
download servers.  These servers are located throughout the world,
as to provide better download times regardless of which network
provider you are using, and regardless of your geographic location.

Three new download servers have recently been added to our network,
further strengthening our file serving capabilities.  These latest

  | 
  | How about something like:
  | 
  |    cd {dest.dir}
  |    tar -C {source.dir} cf - | tar xf -
  | 
  | tar cf - will pipe the tar file to stdout and tar xf - will untar it. This
  | should keep permissions and links, and if you do it as root you will keep
  | the owners too... :)
  | 
  | Not tested, though. You may need other flags as well.

 the above (or something close to it) will work.

 however, the data will be read and written twice by the
 1st (source) `tar', and read twice by the 2nd (sink) `tar',
 albeit only written once as the sink realizes the second
 copy is a hard link to the first.  with c.60Gb of data,
 that will make a difference, at least in time and CPU
 resource consumed (albeit, in this case, not storage).

 the issue here is tar(1) (and cpio(1)) archives always
 contain the data for each name of a hard link.  this is
 (probably) for several reasons, and is not necessarily a
 bad thing.   e.g., it provides a degree of redundancy to
 help cope with bad media.

 the source `tar' is creating an archive, which is being
 written down the pipe (to be consumed by the sink `tar').
 that is why storage is not an issue per se here, as the
 full archive is not ""saved"" --- if it were, you'd need
 at least 2x60Gb, or over 120Gb!   (the extra is `tar's
 overhead, which is minimal but does add up, esp. when
 a ""large"" blocking factor is used.)

How do you feed procmail? Not with a .forward, I'd guess.

How does mail enter your system anyway? Per fetchmail maybe? Or direct 
 SMTP-delivery? Or does it just magically hit your spool?

Lotsa questions...

The ""best"" way to acheive this would be to use LVM above your software
RAID. At that point, it would be very painless, compared to what is
ahead of you now. If you're curious, here would be the steps:

mdadm -C /dev/md0 -n 2 -l 1 -a yes /dev/sd{a,b}
pvcreate /dev/md0
vgcreate home /dev/md0
lvcreate -L 1G -n swap home
lvcreate -L 10G -n root home
lvcreate -l 100%FREE -n home home

Then, for giving more space to home, and less to root, boot off a live
CD, and (assuming you're using ext3/4):

e2fsck /dev/home/root
resize2fs /dev/home/root 6G
lvreduce -L 6G /dev/home/root
lvextend -L +4G /dev/home/home
resize2fs /dev/home/home

That's it! However, because you chose not to use LVM, you will need to
boot of a live CD that supports Linux software RAID, rebuild the array,
and perform the resizing there. I'm not sure if GParted supports this or
not. Worth checking out, however.

I would personally recommend backing up your data, and reinstalling,
with LVM on top of your software RAID. You still have the redundancy,
and you have the awesome flexibility of resizing volumes with great ease.=

Yeah, that'd be cool -- much appreciated!   comparing text classifiers

completely empty (and its previous contents are no longer there
either).

  BTW: talking of spring downunder... I'm in Queensland.  It almost
  feels like early summer already (winters here are dry and warm,
  much better than cold wet miserable Melbourne :-)  Despite some
  recent rain (first in months), we are already into a drought, with
  an El-Nino on the way it is only going to get worse...  (the last
  one in the 90s caused one of the worst droughts ever seen here in
  aussie).

Chris,

I think you are referring to a problem I noticed last October (see 
attached email). If I remember correctly, the binding for SeditBeautify
is being applied outside of the sedit window and that results in the 
behavior observed.

The KResource API is public API of KDE4, it can at best removed at the firs=
t=20
KDE5 version (which is probably still several years away).
Some of its plugins are public API as well (those from kdepimlibs) so they=

stay too.
Problematic are plugins from kdepim, they can be replaced by respective=20
Akonadi base resource implementations.

Right, I think it will run if it does not find its configuration, thus not=

knowing whether it has already run.
Could lead to duplicated resources on Akonadi side though (if it has been r=
un=20
before).

1595,"RE: Java is for kiddies
Misc rants about finding jobs, java vs C, what makes a good programmer, etc.


Okay, hmm, I thought twice about this, but what the hey, jobs are hard to
come by. There's a company hiring in Mountain View, looking for a few good
hackers, no Java, no GUI, not even C++ -- just C and Linux and networking
and good old stuff like that. They just raised a wad of money and they're
looking for a few ""really good programmers"", says the CTO. I know him --
very smart guy. Drives too fast, though, for what that's worth.

Joe Bob says ""check it out"". I'd be happy to pass on your resume, or you can
send it straight to them. Probably won't matter if I pass it on, since I
don't know you guys anyway...

I fear newer drivers. 

The first time I installed nvidia proprietary drivers was 3/4 years ago. 
In that time I was running openSUSE 10.1 and hopefully, nvidia provided 
rpm drivers in their site so installation went straightforward (very easy 
and worked fine: I needed 3D for running Google Earth and Twinview setup 
for the two displays I had attached).

That time (and that time was 4 years ago) I installed the same drivers I 
have nowadays (173.xx). Why I have not updated to the latest ones 
(195.x)? Because ""if it works, don't touch it"" and I don't needed to do 
fancy things in that computer and the old version was (and is still) 
working without glitches.

Related to the MS acquisition of XDegrees?

==
http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271

Sun Nabs Storage Startup
By Clint Boulton
Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San
Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data
storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.

The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup
with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and
virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),
virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices
into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that
is managed from a central console.

Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes
of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after
scouting some 65 companies.

Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com
that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible
acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of
storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such
as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.

""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7
or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a
critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.""

N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)
architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a
role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled
as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and
networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.

While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground
in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,
according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of
IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest
increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,
respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of
$411 million.

Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of
Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002."

Driver who hit moose fights county over meat

By GISELLE GOODMAN, Portland Press Herald Writer
------------------------------------------------------------------------
via http://www.lorencoleman.com
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ACTON  In her freezer at home, Lisa Pierce has ground beef and roasts,
frozen vegetables and french fries, even a couple of Popsicles. What she
doesn't have is the meat of the moose she hit and killed with her car on
Nov. 5, the moose that was rightfully hers, but instead went to a neighbor.

The lack of it has her embroiled in a fight with the York County Sheriff's
Department to get back what she says she is owed.

""I think the deputy thought he was doing me a favor,"" said Pierce. ""I'm a
woman and he just neglected to think that I would want it. The moose is
gone, I know that now. I want to be compensated for the meat.""

Whether or not that happens is uncertain. Her experience, though, highlights
a law some Mainers may not be aware of, but should get to know during this
peak time of deer-versus-car accidents, as the animals, in their mating
season, come out of the woods.

The law is simple: A big-game carcass caught by a car - be it a moose, deer
or bear - goes to the person who hits it, as long as a law enforcement
officer is called to the scene and the vehicle is damaged in the accident.

It comes up quite often in Maine, say officials. Last year, there were 4,055
cases of vehicles and deer colliding on Maine roads and 600 accidents
involving moose, according to Mark Latti, spokesman for the Maine Warden
Service.

""In a state of what, 1.4 million, with only 215,000 licensed hunters, I
don't know how many motor vehicle drivers would know how to dress out a
moose,"" said Latti. ""You do have the option of keeping it.""

Which, for some people, can be valuable compensation for a damaged car.
Farm-grown deer meat can retail for $8 to $20 per pound in stores. And a
butchered or dressed moose, which can't be bought or sold anywhere in Maine,
can produce hundreds of pounds of food.

Latti said when it comes to moose, the law has been abused since its
inception in 1991. Every now and then an officer will issue a summons to a
driver for intentionally killing a moose with a car. That kind of ""hunting""
makes no sense to Latti.

Hitting a moose, even at a slow speed, is no laughing matter. Large adult
moose can weigh up to 1,500 pounds and can be more than 9 feet tall. Since
the bulk of their weight is above the hood level of most cars, their bodies
often come crashing through windshields in collisions. More often than not,
crashes like these damage the vehicle, the people inside and the animal.

Sometimes they are fatal. In 1998, Latti said, there were six moose-related
fatalities. After that, when the number of moose-hunting permits went from
2,000 to 3,000, there were less. Maine had three moose-related fatalities in
2000, one in 2001 and two this year so far, said Stephen McCausland,
spokesman for the Maine Public Safety Department.

Pierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her car
did not become part of that statistic early on Election Day. But she also
feels cheated by the whole situation. After all, her car was totaled.

On the morning of the accident, Pierce was taking her two children and a
neighbor's son to school in her 1991 Dodge Dynasty. She said she was going
along at about 35 mph on a well-traveled road, when a moose came out of
nowhere.

""By the time my brain could see moose, he was part of my windshield,"" she
said. 

Pierce is well aware of the law, so as she sat in the ambulance with the
children, being treated for cuts and bruises, she thought about the moose.
But the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could deal
with it, so she said she wasn't able to follow up on the animal until later
that day.

When she inquired, she was told the deputy on the scene gave the
fully-racked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor.

Her neighbor, she said, subsequently offered her the moose for the $100 it
took him to carry it away, money she didn't think she should spend. By the
time she contacted the Attorney General's Office on Nov. 12 to complain
about the deputy giving her moose away, the neighbor's price had gone up
another $300 for the cost of butchering 450 pounds of meat.

And when she called York County Chief Deputy Maurice Ouellette to complain
that she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer's
fault that she didn't have it, Ouellette told her he could not give her cash
and the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in York
County.

""At that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore, but
wanting money,"" Ouellette said.

That conversation, and a similar one she had with York County Sheriff Phil
Cote, left Pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the
moose.

But the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising to
other officials.

""It's the officer's discretion,"" said Latti. ""And if the officer feels the
person can't immediately remove (the animal), he's got to think of public
safety and other people on the roadway. If someone is worried about her
children in her car, the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to ask
is if she wants the moose.""

Maine State Police Trooper Jeremy Forbes said when he arrives at accidents
that involve a serious injury to a person, the issue of who gets the animal,
deer or moose, becomes secondary.

""The priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital,"" he
said. ""If they are really hurt and going to the hospital, the animal can't
wait, so we'll probably give it to the next person who stops by.""

This is not comforting to Pierce. She said the deputy could have come to the
ambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose. With her
boyfriend, a hunter, nearby, she could have easily taken care of the animal
herself.

She knows her situation is probably a lost cause. But she hopes other
people, especially other women, do not have the same experience.

""What about people who don't know the law?"" she said. ""Standing up for my
rights has just been a big headache.""

Hi,
I have Sun VirtualBox. It's easy to use and install.
The guests OS that I tried and work: Debian, MEPIS, OpenSolaris, 
OpenSuse, Solaris 10, XP and some other Linux distros. DesktopBSD and 
FreeBSD work but can't get GUI -that can be lack of my knowledge.

Same with open VirtualBox except I think that there is no USB support.

Aqemu (qemu) easy to use and install -DesktopBSD work's with GUI.

I think that all VM have file sharing, printing depends on USB if you 
have USB printer.

I currently have 3 TB of data with another 1TB on its way fairly
soon, so 4 drives will become 5 quite soon. Also, I have read that a
common rating of drive failure is an unrecoverable read rate of 1
bit in 10^14 - that is 1 bit in every 10TB. While doing a rebuild
across 4 or 5 drives that would mean it is likely to hit an
unrecoverable read. With RAID 5 (no redundancy during rebuild due to
failed drive) that would be game over. Is this correct?

Google is pretty darned ubiquitous, and has been for 8+ years.

Putting ""Debian play"" in the FF/IW search bar auto-completes ""debian 
play encrypted dvd"", and each of the first 5 links mentions d-mm.o.

""Mentioned"" does *not* mean ""endorsed"".  Never has, never will.

d-mm.o is not an official Debian site, so it's nor mentioned

It doesn't work that way.  A website is opt-in, spam is no-opt.  If you
visit a samizdat site you can get in trouble.  If you get samizdat spam,
the worst that can be said is that you might have read it.  And as long as
the mailers send to individuals who clearly didn't opt-in, like party
officials, then other recipients can't get in trouble for requesting the
mail.  

Plus, it's much harder to block spam than web sites.

But this shouldn't come as a surprize.  Spam is speech.  It may be sleazy, 
but so what.

Both are reliable.  ""Reliability"" is more a function of the software
engineer.  I've written complicated mission-critical server software in
Java that will run without a hiccup as long as the Unix box it is
sitting on is running.  Same with C.  For processes that are running
months at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doing
lots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sure
every conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recovers
to a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is a
design/programming issue.

That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and then
re-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn't scale well as a
language for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. 
The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairly
detailed and low-level control of system resources to get around
bottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't give
you access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out of
a C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune
(or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. 
Nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you
could conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited by
raw performance scalability.

So, as you already discarded FlashPlayer as unique source of your 
reboots, I will take a look into:

1/ System overheating (reboots tend to happen due to high temperatures, 
watch the BIOS CPU temps and control the rpm of the fans).

2/ RAM memory modules and voltages. Check the ram dimms are certified for 
you motherboard and also, look into the BIOS voltages are the correct 
ones for you type of ram.

3/ Hard disks health. You can test this with ""smartcl"".

problems :-/

Hmmm, strange. Well maybe KMail does address completion more directly than=

via KAddressBook. There might be a component in KDEPIM libs doing that for=

KMail. For - just for looking up email address - KMail really calls into=20
Akonadi.

But AFAIK it doesn't use Akonadi - through what ways ever - for anything=20
other than retrieving contact data. Thus the use of Akonadi could not be=20
that wide-spread in KMail.

However, KDEPIM will use Akonadi more and more, so IMHO its better to have=

Akonadi improved and fixed than to remove the Akonadi dependency in KMail=20
temporarily.

I think I could handle commenting out the lowest SPAM_PHRASE_XX_YY
scores.  If the GA could handle this sort of thing so they'd
automatically be zeroed, I'd feel better since the ranges could change
next time the phrase list is regenerated or the algorithm tweaked.

I think we need to understand why DATE_IN_PAST_48_96 is so low before
we remove it.  The two rules on either side perform quite well.

I only want a bugzilla ticket for each one if people are okay with

If you could put the stats for each rule in the ticket somehow (should

I assisted Late President Laurent Kabila to keep US$35M (Thirty Five Millions) in a Security company during the War in My Country.  

Although the security company does not know the content in the boxes deposited as we deposit it as personal effects of Mr. Laurent Kabila. It is in this respect that I seek your help to assist me in the investment of these funds before the present Government headed by the son will have knowledge of this money to avoid being taking away. 

On conclusion of this business, I shall compensate you with 45% of the fund, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open account for my family for investment over there with your assistance.

416,"Turkey City LexiconURL: http://boingboing.net/#85506002
Date: Not supplied

After the talk at UT Austin, I spent Saturday at the Turkey City science 
fiction writers' workshop at Bruce Sterling's place. Turkey City is a venerable 
science fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of 
science fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding 
what works and what doesn't in a work of science fiction: 

    Squid on the Mantelpiece 

    Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the 
    first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot 
    element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic 
    emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming 
    that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It's hard to 
    properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad's bank overdraft when 
    a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the 
    conventional dramatic proprieties and SF's extreme, grotesque, or visionary 
    thematics is known as the ""squid on the mantelpiece."" 

    Card Tricks in the Dark 

    Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private 
    joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia 
    relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and 
    very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose.

Just a personal perception here, it seems as though OpenOffice gets
updated, mostly advancement of Debian versions, quite frequently.
Sometimes frequently enough that I get a bit annoyed at it while some
other packages seem to languish.  Again this is just a personal
perception.  I know that some packages have very active maintainer(s)
and others not.

I've not checked it out closely, but is alioth.debian.org similar to
Ubuntu's Launchpad where community members can set up their own personal
archive?  It seems as though someone who shows a personal interest and
(pardon the pun) aptitude with packaging could thus gain some
recognition and become a maintainer with a bit more effort.   Perhaps I
am all wrong.

1694,"RE: Our friends the Palestinians, Our servants in government.When a settler goes postal and kills some Palestinians they are treated
as a criminal, not celebrated in word and song.

But you knew that.

When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target
children with a homicide-bomb, they are careful to dip the shrapnel in
rat poison.  It helps prevent blood clotting in the victims, you see.

I'm sure all those Jewish homicide-bombers do the same.  Oh wait, there
aren't any.

If the Palestinians are driven completely out, either by expulsion or
death, they will have nobody to blame but themselves.  That won't stop
them or you from pretending otherwise.

587,"Re: Minor whoops with glimpse supportThere are some cases like this with ""incomplete ftoc"".  These are surely old
bugs that appeared after I added the ability to only scan the tail of the ftoc

around a bit. glimpse.tcl uses Msg_Change, which has code in it to try and
deal with showing a message that isn't in the ftoc:
        Exmh_Status ""Cannot find msg $msgid - Rescan?""
Is that message hiding in your log?  Perhaps there should be a return from
Msg_Change that glimpse.tcl can use to decide what to do next.

Gotta wonder what the GPG config stuff in ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults looks 
like.  Also gotta wonder what the message headers in the offending 
message are saying to nmh/exmh.  My set-up works perfectly.  That is, 
I get a pop-up window to enter my passphrase into, and when I type it 
correctly, the message display changes from a prompt to click to 
decrypt to the message content.

263,"Attn: How about being a few pounds lighter?OLIBYKNHow are you doing?

If you've been like me, you've been trying almost
EVERYTHING to lose weight. I know how you feel
- the special diets, miracle pills, and fancy exercise 
equipment never helped me lose the pounds I needed to lose
either. It seemed like the harder I worked at it, the less
weight I lost - until I heard about 'Extreme Power Plus'.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Oh geez, not another
miracle diet pill!"" Like you, I was skeptical at first, but 
my sister said it helped her lose 23 pounds in just 2 weeks, 
so I told her I'd give it a try. I mean, there was nothing 
to lose except a lot of weight! Let me tell you, it was
the best decision I've ever made.  PERIOD.  Six months later,
as I'm writing this message to you, I've gone from 355 pounds
to 210 pounds, and I haven't changed my exercise routine or diet
at all. Yes, I still eat pizza, and lots of it!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted the manufacturer
and received permission to resell it - at a HUGE discount.I feel
the need to help other people lose weight like I did, because it
does so much for your self-esteem, not to mention your health.
I am giving you my personal pledge that 'Extreme Power Plus'
absolutely WILL WORK FOR YOU. 100 % Money-Back GUARANTEED!

If you are frustrated with trying other products, without having 
any success, and just not getting the results you were promised,
then I recommend the only product that worked for me - 
'EXTREME POWER PLUS'!

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how does this stuff
actually work?""

Extreme Power Plus contains Lipotropic fat burners and ephedra which 
is scientifically proven to increase metabolism and cause rapid 
weight loss. No ""hocus pocus"" in these pills - just RESULTS!!! 

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you lose 10-15 pounds per week naturally, without
exercising and without having to eat rice cakes all day. 
Just try it for one month - there's pounds to lose and confidence 
to gain! You will lose weight fast - GUARANTEED. This is my
pledge to you.

BONUS! Order NOW & get FREE SHIPPING on 3 bottles or more! 

To order Extreme Power Plus on our secure server, just click

It appears impractical to separate the enhancement from the fix, since the
former is dependent on the latter.  I will open the bug report as a wishlist
enhancement request and provide the patches.  If it is accepted, the LDL
bug will get fixed too as a fringe benefit.

Techs fall again with telecoms, Dow drops below 8K
The day after WorldCom Group filed for bankruptcy protection, telecom shares suffered and helped drag down the tech sector.

BellSouth stock tumbled 18.07 percent after it missed Wall Street's earnings target and offered a worse-than-expected outlook.  With shares of SBC Communications, Qwest Communications International, Sprint and AT&T also dropping, CNET's Tech index shed 48.86 points, or 5.3 percent, to 897.37. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 36.5 points, or 2.77 percent, to 1,282.55.

With a report raising questions about Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s role in the Enron fiasco, broader markets lost ground as well. After a see-saw session, the Dow Jones industrials ended down 234.7 points, or 2.93 percent, to 7,784.5. The S&P 500 slid 27.90 points, or 3.29 percent, to 819.85.















BellSouth posts lower second-quarter profits 
BellSouth Corp., the No. 3 U.S. local telephone company, on Monday posted lower second-quarter profits due to slack demand and turbulent economic conditions in North America and Latin America.

BellSouth, the dominant local telephone company in nine Southeastern states from Kentucky to Florida, said net income fell to 16 cents a share from 47 cents a year earlier. BELLSOUTH CORP 22.61 -18.11% 

WorldCom, BellSouth news adds to telecom gloom 
WorldCom Inc.'s bankruptcy filing is only the latest in a long line of sad news for a slumping telecom industry grappling with soft demand, falling earnings and worries about accounting.

And things are not likely to change any time soon, as signaled by BellSouth Corp.'s disappointing second-quarter earnings and downward revision to its full-year outlook, analysts and investors said on Monday.WORLDCOM INC-WORLDCOM TRCK STK 0.14 55.56%

A jury in Florida ruled last week that Gateway must pay $3.6 million for a typo in which it sent customers with a PC problem to an 800 number owned by Pensacola, Fla.-based Mo' Money Associates instead of the company's own complaint line, which had a similar number but with an 888 prefix.HEWLETT-PACKARD CO 12.00 -6.25%

Tyco CFO's tenure seen ending as confidence wanes 
Tyco International Ltd.'s earnings release on Tuesday may very well be the last for Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz, whose tenure has been marred by his close association with the conglomerate's disgraced former chairman.
Named CFO in 1995, Swartz has been the chief defender of Tyco's accounting, which has drawn fire for being opaque and misleading. But perhaps more important, Swartz was a key adviser and architect in Dennis Kozlowski's decade-long acquisition binge to build Tyco into one of the world's largest manufacturing conglomerates.TYCO INTERNATIONAL 11.85 -5.12%

Thanks.  I think this is the approach I'm going to take.  I just tried
install barebones Squeeze in Virtualbox, and I'm running into packaging
problems when I try to install certain software from Lenny (LXDE and
apt-show-versions, for example).

I am sorry if I upset people. I was faced with a situation that I did

I have seen barcode and magnetic scanners that simply pass string.
Maybe you are right, maybe that is how this works. We'll see.

5 Ways to Create a Unique Website
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Internet users have no doubt seen several websites of identical
design. This is often because webmasters do not have the
ability or time to design and create unique websites. These
five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind design
for your website.

1. Navigation System

Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase 
(http://www.webmasterbase.com) for example. There is a list 
of categories on the left, and information about the network 
on the top bar.

It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because:

- People see the top of the page first
- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation gets
   pushed to bottom of the page... away from the visitor.

2. Color Scheme

When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast. For
example, do not use bright green and florescent pink. Some
colors that are often used are white on black or black on
white.

A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color Schemer
(http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/), created by Aaron
Epstein. Many other programs exist that can assist you in
choosing colors. Try doing a search on FreewareFiles 
(http://www.freewarefiles.com), Tucows (http://www.tucows.com),
or Download.com (http://www.download.com) for ""color schemer.""

3. Content Window

This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text here
is easy to read and understand.

Also, provide your own original content. People do not want to
hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear what 
you want to say! While it might be time consuming to write
your own content, it sure is worth it.

To find content for your website, try searching at
EzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com). Other people may
have used the articles, but if you become good friends with the
authors, they may send you new content as they write it. Be
careful though. Do not use too much content from other 
authors, as mentioned above.

4. Font(s)

Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)

Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can be 
used for long pieces of text.

The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making it
easier to read.

5. Advertising

Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing 
that almost every website has. The most common type is what 
is known as ""banner"" advertising. It is called that because it is 
long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long you ask? The 
generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.

New sizes however are being used. Take for example the new
style called ""skyscraper"" -- so called for a reason: it looks
like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not too
wide (about 100-125 pixels.)

Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners 
used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the page.
Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in the middle
of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.

    Conclusion

These are only five things to consider when designing a
website. There are many others however. Let me know what 
you find that helps you create a unique website. My email 
address is mailto:corbb@justforwebmasters.com.

         5 Ways to Create a Unique WebsiteInternet users have no doubt seen several websites of
identical design. This is often because webmasters do not
have the ability or time to design and create unique websites.
These five points will help you come up with a one-of-a-kind
design for your website.
1. Navigation System
Deciding on a navigation system should be one of the first
things to consider when designing your website. Visitors
usually look for a way to get to the information they want
before reading anything else. I would suggest putting your
navigation system in two areas. Look at WebmasterBase
(http://www.webmasterbase.com)
for example. There is a list
of categories on the left, and information about the network
on the top bar.
It is not recommended that you place your navigation at the
bottom of the page because:
- People see the top of the page first
- If you have a lot of content on one page, the navigation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gets pushed to bottom of the page... away from the
visitor.
2. Color Scheme
When you are choosing colors, make sure they contrast.
For example, do not use bright green and florescent pink.
Some colors that are often used are white on black or black
on white.
A wonderful utility that is web-based and free is Color
Schemer (http://www.godigitalstudios.com/www/color/),
created by Aaron Epstein. Many other programs exist that
can assist you in choosing colors. Try doing a search on
FreewareFiles (http://www.freewarefiles.com),
Tucows
(http://www.tucows.com), or Download.com
(http://www.download.com) for
""color schemer.""
3. Content Window
This is the brain of the website. Make sure that the text
here is easy to read and understand.
Also, provide your own original content. People do not want
to hear what somebody else has to say. They want to hear
what you want to say! While it might be time consuming to
write your own content, it sure is worth it.
To find content for your website, try searching at
EzineArticles (http://www.ezinearticles.com).
Other people
may have used the articles, but if you become good friends
with the authors, they may send you new content as they
write it. Be careful though. Do not use too much content
from other authors, as mentioned above.
4. Font(s)
Several types of fonts exist. The first one I will discuss is
fixed width or monospace, similar to Courier or Courier New.
Fixed width fonts are good for displaying code (like HTML.)
Another type of font is called sans serif. It is similar to
Arial (Windows) or Helvetica (Macintosh). This font can
be used for long pieces of text.
The final type of font is called serif because it has serifs,
or curves, in each letter. Often, this font is called Times
(Windows) or Georgia (Macintosh). This font, like sans serif,
is often used for long blocks of text. It is preferred because
its rounded edges lead the reader to the next letter, making
it easier to read.
5. Advertising
Ah, everybody's favorite... advertising! This is one of thing
that almost every website has. The most common type is
what is known as ""banner"" advertising. It is called that
because it is long and thin (like a paper banner.) How long
you ask? The generic kind is 468 pixels wide by 60 pixels high.
New sizes however are being used. Take for example the
new style called ""skyscraper"" -- so called for a reason: it
looks like a skyscraper. It is tall (about 425 pixels) but not
too wide (about 100-125 pixels.)
Finding a way to place advertising can be tricky. Banners
used to be placed (and still are) only at the top of the
page.&nbsp; Nevertheless, banners are starting to be placed in
the middle of the page, at the bottom, or along the side.
Conclusion
These are only five things to consider when designing a
website. There are many others however. Let me know

I've done that too, on many production servers. The only little
(unimportant) catch is to replace ""kernel-headers"" by ""glibc-kernheaders"",
a simple ""apt-get install glibc-kernheaders"" taking care of that.

Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and
releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded,
some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different
dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through
apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered
as the newest, thus being kept on the system.

As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas
or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc
(and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll
probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-)

1074,"[Spambayes] hammie.py vs. GBayes.pyThere seem to be two ""drivers"" for the classifier now: Neale Pickett's
hammie.py, and the original GBayes.py.  According to the README.txt,
GBayes.py hasn't been kept up to date.  Is there anything in there
that isn't covered by hammie.py?  About the only useful feature of
GBayes.py that hammie.py doesn't (yet) copy is -u, which calculates
spamness for an entire mailbox.  This feature can easily be copied
into hammie.py.  (GBayes.py also has a large collection of tokenizers;
but timtoken.py rules, so I'm not sure how interesting that is now.)

Therefore I propose to nuke GBayes.py, after adding a -u feature.

Anyone against?  (I imagine that Skip or Barry might have a stake in
GBayes.py; Tim seems to have moved all code he's working to other
modules.)

1594,"Securing multiple virtual hostsI am trying to secure three of four virtual hostnames on our Apache server.
We are not taking credit card orders or user's personal information, but are
merely hoping to secure email and calendar web transactions for our users.
We are not running any secure applications on the root host.

I have been testing this week with CA, client, and host certificate
requests, certificates, and keys, and think I have a fairly good beginner's
grasp of the commands and command line options.


My questions are:

1.  Is it necessary to create a CA certificate for each of the secure
virtual hosts, or can one CA certificate for the root be used to sign each
of the keys for all three common names we are trying to secure?

2.  Even though the root host is not conducting secure transactions, am I
correct in configuring the server with a CACertificateFile in the main body
of httpsd.conf and then setting the CACertificateFile for each virtual host
in the  section of httpsd.conf?  This sort of assumes the
answer to 1. is  - you need a CA for each virtual host.

3.  Is it necessary to create a client certificate to distribute to our
users, or is it sufficient to have the CA certificate and a server
certificate for the virtual hosts?  Wouldn't a client certificate only be
necessary if we were trying to verify the client's identity?  Would that be
a good idea given our scenario?

Thanks in advance for your help.

It would?
Sounds like you are talking about setting up a company, to be a vendor....
I'd venture the early days of Debian, Slackware and other involveds there
was no such financing.

It is actually a lot worse than this.  What it boils down to is that
only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. 
What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively
still exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top
executive and management positions in the major French firms and the
government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not
officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws
and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. 
Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them
from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many
can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about
the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about
it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect
this may hold true for other European countries as well.  

After all those ""revolutions"", France is still nothing more than a

Yes, confirming what I said in my last message. Ah! I see where the problem 
lies! You seem to be labouring under the misapprehension that Zimbabwe and 
Zambia are the same country.

(For me, personally, it's theoretical, as I only am repeating things I 
have picked up.  It may be out of date, now, but if I had to guess, the 
level of threat has only grown.)

It depends on the mechanism used to share the folders.  If if is through 
a network interface, then the risks are similar to the risks on any 
trusted intranet.

If the folders are provided by the VM internals, then the risk is what 
you can lose by a successful attack on the guest kernel or the host VM. 
  If the host VM is kernel-based, then the risk is that of a (host) 
kernel attack.

Note: I'm using ""risk"" as in ""what can you lose?""  If you mean attack 
vectors, then those should be evident; again, I am not a security 
reseacher.  Google Joanna Rutkowska.  She probably knows as much as 
anyone about breaking out of a VM to attack the host.

I'm sure others on this list know more than I do about it.

Migrating from Lenny to Squeeze (or any migration, really) is tricky.
You can't just change your /etc/apt/sources.list file to point to the
squeeze repositories and then do ""aptitude update;aptitude full-upgrade"".
The problem you are describing above is only the first of your problems
if you have done that.  You need to follow the upgrade outline mentioned
in the Release Notes.  You didn't say how you did it, and it's too late
in any case, but I just wanted to mention that while we're on the subject.

Assuming that you did the migration properly, this may be a device name
issue.  There's been some problems with device names recently, particularly
with IDE hard disks.  It hasn't happened to me, but others have reported
device names going from /dev/hdx to /dev/sdx and back again with
subsequent maintenance.  You may have to boot from a rescue disk,
edit your /etc/fstab to change device names, according to what they
are now, and rebuild your initial RAM file system.

If that is the issue, an alternative to traditional device names is
to use UUIDs.

With project budgets in the multiple millions of dollars and virtually no 
margin for error, more and more development teams are under tremendous pressure 
to come out on top of the entertainment software market's cutthroat 
competition. No team manager wants to contemplate dropping the ball when 
creating the vivid graphics necessary to help make a game a success. Electronic 
Arts' The Sims franchise is an excellent example of this pressurized situation. 
This article highlights the critical issues that govern the high volume asset 
production needed for today's most demanding games."

501,"CD player UI for toddlersSo, like many young children, my daughter Tatum (age 21 months) *really*
likes music. She also likes to have control over her environment, and this
means she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting
the music playing.

By watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design
from watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market
niche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.

The CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but
doesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead
requiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI
disaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the
button again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever
get music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a
surprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again
when the music doesn't play.

For toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,
within half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the
button multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't
change the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you
press, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be
the same.

The back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI
disaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle
CDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a
problem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,
that edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and
wiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but
which hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it
hasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to
understand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the
CD.

Tatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is
a mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the
player into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing
the play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,
but uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and
FM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the
binary distinction of music/no music.

What would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start
playing a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it
would give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.
The other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half
the size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so
there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.
The play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of
the player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The
device would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip
open at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It
should be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2'
without affecting the player.

135,"asynchronous I/O (was Re: Gasp!)Of course we've had select() since BSD 4.2 and poll() since System V
or so, and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I/O up to a
hundred or so channels, but suck after that; /dev/poll (available in
Solaris and Linux) is one approach to solving this; Linux has a way to
do essentially the same thing with real-time signals, and has for
years; and FreeBSD has kqueue.

More details about these are at
http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/

None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap
disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just
use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O.

POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most
proprietary Unixes implement.  The Linux kernel hackers are currently
rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to
work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient
synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other
way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too.

It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying
things like ""Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any
idea at all how the hardware functions,"" but he's totally off-base.
People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but
apparently some don't, so I'll rebut.

Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the
original stupid errors.

In detail, he wrote:

Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years
ago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing
for many years.  Very few applications need the aio_* calls ---
essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them
at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with
multiple threads or processes.  This just provides a modicum of extra
performance.

Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs
come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is
13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice.
They might be even older than that.

Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations
have supported multithreading for a decade or more.

Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion with
a ""signal"", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a ""signal"" causes
the immediate execution of a ""signal handler"" in a process.  By
contrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such
as completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process
polls them.

I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case
(although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the
technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.
Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous
network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal
queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().

(This is all guess work and may be bogus.)

Are you running Gnome 1.4? I had similar problems as did several
co-workers. Updating my Gnome components has fixed it for me and
others, although I can't say exactly which component did the
trick. Gnomecore or gtk would seem most likely, but it may have been
something else.

In any case, I have not seen the problem for quite a while, now.

I agree.  In a way, I signed up just by buying steaks from them.  However, once
I tell them to stop, everything after that is spam.  I told them to stop *many*
times.

It's a pity, too, since they have great steaks.  Buying from them is just not
worth having to put up with all of that clinginess.

746,"[Spambayes] hammie.py vs. GBayes.pyThere seem to be two ""drivers"" for the classifier now: Neale Pickett's
hammie.py, and the original GBayes.py.  According to the README.txt,
GBayes.py hasn't been kept up to date.  Is there anything in there
that isn't covered by hammie.py?  About the only useful feature of
GBayes.py that hammie.py doesn't (yet) copy is -u, which calculates
spamness for an entire mailbox.  This feature can easily be copied
into hammie.py.  (GBayes.py also has a large collection of tokenizers;
but timtoken.py rules, so I'm not sure how interesting that is now.)

Therefore I propose to nuke GBayes.py, after adding a -u feature.

Anyone against?  (I imagine that Skip or Barry might have a stake in
GBayes.py; Tim seems to have moved all code he's working to other
modules.)

435,"UAE/Ami*/Linux Laptop:  Important details.Well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got to
just run Amithlon (or if that wasn't so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD!

This is a near-term thing I could look forward to!

However, an 'official' laptop seems unexciting to me with only
the items mentioned.  Most important are the particulars distinguishing
the listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably:
1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the
   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is
   not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would
   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.
   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics
   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,
   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and
    portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)

1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of 'internet keys'
    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll
    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.

1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)
    in BIOS, please.

2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan
   to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off
   the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good
  for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you've got an
  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)
     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs
  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display
  half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion
  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)
      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative
  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle
  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally
  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them
  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides
  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little
  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep
  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) 

3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the
    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to
    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but
    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified
   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the
   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with
   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides
   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted
   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.
     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,
   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see
   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of 'indian red' that are great
   candidates) base.  
      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight
    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-
    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare
    hood) to feed
    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent 
    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.
      The logo should be a coloration of a
   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew
   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/
   at first blush.  We'll see what comes out of the contest and
   maybe you'll like the mapping MathCAD does of the
   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the
   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.
   MAA.org has more references, I'm sure.

4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.

Other details:
USB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that's unavailable.
Options like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port
should round out the offering.  An option for just-released 
.13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more
reviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption,
and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.
CompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card
interfaces would be very pleasant.  I've mentioned booting to
USB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.
To that end, a backup solution with compression using
USB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice 
bundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....


Blue skies (and clear water and fresh air): 
Waterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.
Svelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,
builtin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and 
frontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory map
and various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that
says 'This is Amiga Speaking' when stroked 'round. 
Decent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps 
an ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as 
keyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.
2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple 
18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our
(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.
Actual 7"" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation 
fan location for real void-comp (the test in Blade
Runner) style cooling and extended bass; active cooling
and airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user
seat and provide mineral water.

All excellent points, Boyd.  Fortunately in this case, extlinux appears
to be a viable solution.  I'll soon know.  The guy I need to see about
setting a test server to test the backup and restore scenario
has been off work with a sick child for the past couple of days, but when
he gets back I'll try to prove that it is 100% compatible with our

We sometimes approach our analysts for their thoughts on emerging market sectors we're interested in. On certain occasions, they come to us with intriguing insights of certain aspects of the market that have caught their attention.

As you know our track record speaks for itself we are happy to bring you another situation with HUGE upside potential we think this could be the one that when we look back shortly everyone will be saying I should have more.

OK, I'll tell you what.  Since I know that a newer version which fixes
at least one bug I'm experiencing is waiting in the wings in Sid,
and since Squeeze hasn't frozen yet, I'll wait until the new version
migrates to Squeeze.  (Let's hope that Squeeze doesn't freeze first.)
And then I'll try again.  And if I still get the same error, I'll
at least *try* to come up with a test case.

1376,"cross-platform developmentHey all,

	I realize this has come up before, but I am still confused after  
reading through the old emails. I have an app that uses Quicktime for  
Java. I would like to, maybe not right away, but at some point, update  
my app to do the right thing. The right thing, apparently, is to use  
QTKit, because it is the only 64-bit solution.

	This seems crazy to me, though, because it is OS X specific, which  
means I need another solution for windows. What is the 64-bit solution  
(going to be) for windows? Does this mean every developer who wants to  
write cross-platform QT code (not just Java) is supposed to write  
their own portability layer for QuickTime? Is there an open source  
solution out there or in the works? Is there another solution that  
people are using other than QT?

I need file conversion from a wide variety of file types (esp audio)  
and video playback, although I will need some editing in the future.  
JMF+JavaSound won't cut it. Not even close. I need way more file  
formats than they support. You used to be able to use QTJ as a plugin  
for JMF to provide file reading/writing. Perhaps there is a way to do  
that with a minimal QT Java layer? Okay, now I'm just thinking out  
loud. Sorry.

	Any thoughts, advice pointers are appreciated. I have not seen the  
cross-platform issue addressed, and the only replacements for QTJ I've  
seen are OS Specific (eg rococoa).

thanks,

	bjorn

Every senior wants to hear about the roth conversion if you can

conversion program from GSL Advisory. 

The cheapest and most successful way to generate roth conversion program
leads is to send postcards while also placing an ad in the small local
paper. Repeat the ads and the postcard mailing at least 6 different
times.

The one truth in advertising is that repetition works. Even the smallest
and most unassuming ad works if it is seen several times. See if you can
find an area that has its own zip code and a local paper serving that
area. Some retirement communities have both a newspaper and their own
zip code.

This is your gold mine.

There is plenty of space. I think something messed up the permissions cause

Stop Those Presses! Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All

October 2, 2002
By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 




 

Apparently it fell into the category ""too good to check.""


Last Friday, several British newspapers reported that the
World Health Organization had found in a study that blonds
would become extinct within 200 years, because blondness
was caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The
reports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News
program ""Good Morning America,"" and on Saturday by CNN. 

There was only one problem, the health organization said in
a statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds
would become extinct, and it had never done a study on the
subject. 

""W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports
originated,"" said the organization, an agency of the United
Nations based in Geneva, ""but would like to stress that we
have no opinion of the future existence of blonds."" 

All the news reports, in Britain and the United States,
cited a study from the World Health Organization - ""a
blonde-shell study,"" as The Daily Star of London put it.
But none reported any scientific details from the study or
the names of the scientists who conducted it. 

On ""Good Morning America,"" Charles Gibson began a
conversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:
""There's a study from the World Health Organization, this
is for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women
and men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural
blonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth
within 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as
brunets."" 

Ms. Sawyer said she was ""somewhat of a natural blonde.""


Jeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the
anchors got the information from an ABC producer in London
who said he had read it in a British newspaper. 

In London, The Sun and The Express both reported that
unnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in
Scandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected
the last true blond to hail from Finland. 

The British accounts were replete with the views of
bleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow
blondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare
genes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an
endangered species. 

Journalists in London said last night that the source of
the reports was probably one of several European news
agencies that are used by the British press, but it
remained unclear which one. 

Tim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the
report was probably distributed by The Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency. ""Several papers picked it
up,"" he said. 

But Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press
Association, said that although it had considered running
the report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking
to the World Health Organization. 

""We didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to the
World Health Organization first,"" she said. ""They told us
that report was two years old, and had been covered at the
time. They said it had been picked up again that day by a
German news agency."" 

She added that she did not know which agency the
organization was referring to. 

Dr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California
at San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for
blond hair ""sounds patently incorrect.""

It looks like the error was due to an autoconf I had run earlier while
troubleshooting.  I wiped it all out, started over again with the newer
zlib1g-dev in place and all worked.  We are rather ecstatic.  Thanks -

I have been able to login to KDE after the upgrade. Somehow
plasma-desktop was uninstalled during the process :(

I was able to set the TV on the right of my monitor with proper
resolution. I haven't checked yet if this settings stay after I relogin
or not (should have been in bed half an hour ago). One thin which still
happens is that the KDE panel goes to the TV screen (HDMI signal). How

That's similar to using hard-locks (either the old parallel, or the new
usb).

The problem is that that piece of hardware is trustworthy, but the rest of
the PC isn't, so a cracker just needs to simulate the lock/smart card, or
peek at the executable after the lock has been deactivated.

Battery pack, huh what???

You dont use batteries for a 1/4 mile run, you use capacitors. MANY times
the energy density, and you can get the energy out fast enough. Note that
the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run
anyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.
200 MPH should be no problem.

	I'm no longer able to play encrypted dvd's using the xine rpm from freshrpms. 
I think it was about a week ago when I last rented some dvd's, worked just 
fine, but apparently since the latest xine update on freshrpms, it won't 
anymore. 
The output is :

input_dvd: Sorry, this plugin doesn't play encrypted DVDs. The legal status
           of CSS decryption is unclear and we can't provide such code.
           Please check http://dvd.sf.net for more information.

I'm pretty sure it worked with the previous freshrpms release... Any way of 
rolling back updates ?

I am logging to syslog (the protocol) and replaced syslog (the package)
with syslog-ng. syslog-ng can be configured to do this:

destination df_syslog {
        file(""/var/log/$HOST/$YEAR/$MONTH/$DAY/syslog""
        template(""$ISODATE $HOST $MSG\n"")
        owner(root) group(root) perm(0600) dir_perm(0700) create_dirs(yes));
};

This is a snipped that configures a file in a directory-structure matching
the hostname and the date (you should be able to guess the details...)

http://www.syslog.org/syslog-ng/v2/ has some more examples.

It doesn't matter. Mixing apt-get and aptitude is not a problem anymore.

I've seen this recently in #debian and we were able to ""fix"" this with
the following in /etc/X11/xorg.conf

Section ""Device""
        Identifier ""r128""
        Driver ""r128""
        Option ""NoAccel""
EndSection

the related bug report is [1] and this will disable acceleration for
your card, so it is not really a good fix. You might also want to make
sure that you have the firmware package(s) installed.

Good luck

I tried using module assistant with kernel 2.6.32 and it failed, so I 
downloaded the .run file from nvidia and it built (after issuing ""export 
CC=/usr/bin/gcc-4.3"") and installed and runs fine here (squeeze amd64).  Did 
you (OP) purge the Debian packages first, and did you use nvidia-xconfig to 
generate a conf file?

It's not the rpm, it's the rpm-system with you. The cache seems to have 
rottened. Try removing /var/lib/rpm/__db*

Recently I wanted to add the capability of adding QTMovie screenshots =
there, but I'm having some issues.

When the service is run by a user which currently has a graphical login, =
it works fine - I can load a QTMovie, and grab a frame from a specific =
time to be used in the image export.


However, in the production environment, the app is run by a user which =
is not logged in. Everything else (Quartz) works fine, but QTMovie =
loading bails out with this:

=
/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component=
/AVA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011=20
=
/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component=
/AVA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011=20
_RegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to =
the WindowServer, _CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL
=
/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component=
/AVA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011=20

Is there a way to work around this? I only want to get the poster image =
from that movie, nothing else. I can detect in my code when I'm not =
connected to the windowserver with CGGetOnlineDisplayList, so I can =
switch to a different code path if required.

Regards,
Orestis Markou=

Don't run SA on mails this large. Most people tend to ignore mails 
larger than about 250K in spamassassin processing, because it just kills 
performance. There are some known issues with the parsing (such as the 
HTML parsing stuff which is much improved in 2.40 which we're soon to 
release), but nothing that's too likely to be fixed by 2.40. Perhaps in 
2.50 though.

Matt.

_Ian Hickson_: #include web-log.txt[1]. &#8220;I used some of Perl's niftier 
features, such as using method lookup instead of a switch statement for the 
preprocessing instruction dispatching, and exceptions instead of passing error 
codes back and forth.&#8221; He he. Perl programmers are so cute when they 
imitate Python programmers.

You must be kidding. Or at least you must be unaware about the existence 
of pdftk toolkit, iTex and gnupdf library, xournal or pdfedit, a set of 
applications and frameworks available in this ""GNU/Linux world"", intended 
for PDF editing and manipulation.

There is more than PDF/A (a PDF spec for archiving purposes) out there. 

Have you ever heard about PDF forms (editing required), about adding 
bookmarks inside a PDF file structure, about making annotations or 
markups or just creating a link?

There are many situations where the user has the PDF file but lacks the 
original document, and if you want to perform any modification in that 
file, we (linux users) are stuck :-/

849,"Still looking for a house?My name is Jeremy Lessaris. I'm looking for investment properties in the Midwest. The issue I've been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I'm looking for. You know the houses that you are almost sure will not sell; maybe they're really ugly or need a lot of work or are in a bad neighborhood. But for what ever reason, the houses just don't sell.

I need those houses...

Most of the agents I've dealt with were hesitant because there isn't much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use ""unconventional"" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) 

I'm not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don't be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I'll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I'm interested or not. 

If you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com

It could also be due to the browser not copying certain characters
correctly to the clipboard.

Let's start at the beginning, which output do you get from this command:

  locale

If you use an utf8-based locale, e.g. ""en_US.UTF-8"", then the following
command should print the numbers 1-5 in superscript:

  echo -e ""\xc2\xb9\xc2\xb2\xc2\xb3\xe2\x81\xb4\xe2\x81\xb5""

What do you get?

> how can i gain the ability to type a power of 2?

If the locale is set up correctly and your terminal supports the
characters, then the easiest method is to define a compose key and use
 + ""^"" + ""2"". (The ""+"" means pressing the keys in sequence,
releasing each key before pressing the next one.)

Argh!! I did upgrade to acroreat 9.3.1 from multimedia unstable upon
these responses and the referenced article which was based upon 9.x.  I
even set a LID_LIBRARY_PATH variable in case it was not a typo.  It
still doesn't work.  Setting the command line debugging variable, I
found that it cannot find the PPD file.  Does it only work if the CUPS
server is running locally? In our case, we use a central CUPS server
running on a non-standard port.  This is reflected
in /etc/cups/client.conf.  How do we tell acroread where the printer
server and PPD files are? Thanks - John

Quite some modules from CPAN do have a line like this nowadays (I think or 
read so somewhere, respectively). And the Perl error message is very clear: 
""ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 2.""

I could think of a solution: We could remove the ""use"" line and add the 
version to PREREQ_PM. After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines 
  require ExtUtils::MakeMaker; 
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker->VERSION(5.45); 
to do per hand what 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl 
Makefile.PL` will die with a ""Uncaught exception from user code: 
ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 103."" there but we've got a Makefile. But I don't know if 
CPAN will run the make anyway...

We could call the preprocessor on install time. That's not a very clean 
approach but could work. 
 
We can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We 
already have a useless line ""pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made"" there. Adding 
some commands in this section gives some make warnings (""Makefile:933: 
warning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' Makefile:877: warning: 
ignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'"") but does work. Not a very good 
solution either.

The ""use MakeMaker::..."" error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it's ok 
to require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA 
installation. But that's just my opinion ;-) 
 
I'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution. They should know.

If you're writing an smtpd from scratch in Perl, why reinvent the wheel?

This is exactly the reason I chose Debian 10 years ago when I was looking
for my first Linux distro.  I told a friend I wanted a server distro that
wasn't going to spoon feed me, but make me learn something about Linux.

Casey, a seasoned Debian sysadmin, recommended I download the Debian net
install floppies and do my first install from the mirrors, only a compact
base install, and to install everything else I needed by hand with apt.
That was Potato with a 2.2 kernel.

I only use Linux for non-GUI servers.  I don't use desktop Linux.  All my
admin'ing requires knuckle busting. ;)  And I like it that way.

EMAIL FAX: 1 561 619 2791
EMAIL:mrjoemark@yahoo.com

DEAR SIR
 
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP  STRICTLY
CONFIDENTIAL.
 
Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though
I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make
anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you
that all will be well at the end of the day. 

We have decided to contact you first by your email due
to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed that it will take at least two to
three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So we
decided it is best using the email. Let me start by
first introducing myself properly to you. I am Dr.
Kaku Opa, a director general in the Ministry 
of Mines and Power and I head a Three-man tender board
appointed by the Government of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria to award contracts to individuals and
companies and to approve such contract payments in the
Ministry of Mines and Power. The duties of the
committee also include evaluation, vetting and
monitoring of work done by foreign and local
contractors in the ministry.

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and
reputable person to handle a very confidential
business transaction which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring
maximum confidence. In order to commence this
business, we solicit for your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said funds. 

The source of this funds is as follows: Between 1996
and 1997, this committee awarded contracts to various
contractors for engineering, procurement, supply of
electrical equipments such as Transformers, and some
rural electrification projects. 

However, these contracts were over-invoiced by the
committee, thereby, leaving the sum of US$11.5million
dollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred thousand United
States Dollars) in excess. This was done with the
intention that the committee will share the excess
when the payments are approved. 

The Federal Government have since approved the total
contract sum which has been paid out to the companies
and contractors concerned which executed the
contracts, leaving the balance of $11.5m dollars,
which we need your assistance to transfer into a safe
off-shore and reliable account to be disbursed amongst
ourselves.

We need your assistance as the funds are presently
secured in an escrow account of the Federal Government
specifically set aside for the settlement of
outstanding payments to foreign contractors. We are
handicapped 
in the circumstances as the civil service code of
conduct, does not allow us to operate off-shore
accounts, hence your importance in the whole
transaction. 

My colleagues and I have agreed that if you or your
company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on
our behalf, you or your company will retain 20% of the
total amount of US$11,500,000.00 (Eleven Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars), while 70%
will be for us (members of this panel) and the
remaining 10% will be used in offsetting all
debts/expenses incurred (both local and foreign) in
the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust
reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return
we demand your complete honesty and trust. 

It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here, the
assumption is that your company won the major contract
and sub-contracted it out to other companies.  More
often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontract
to more specialized firms for execution of such
contracts. We are civil servants and we will not want
to miss this once in a life time opportunity.

You must however, NOTE that this transaction will be
strictly based on the following terms and conditions
as we have stated below, as we have heard confirmed
cases of business associates running away with funds
kept in their custody when it finally arrive their
accounts. We have decided that this transaction will
be based completely on the following: 

(a). Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence. 

(b). That you would treat this transaction with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. 

(c). That upon receipt of the funds, you will promptly
release our share (70%) on demand after you have
removed your 20% and all expenses have been settled. 

(d). You must be ready to produce us with enough
information about yourself to put our minds at rest. 

Please, note that this transaction is 100% legal and
risk free and we hope to conclude the business in Ten
Bank working days from the date of  receipt of the
necessary information and requirement from you. 

Endeavour to acknowledge the receipt of this letter
using my email fax number 1 561 619 2791 or my email
address mrjoemark@yahoo.com. I will bring you into
the
complete picture of the transaction when I have heard
from you. 

Your urgent response will be highly appreciated as we
are already behind schedule for this financial
quarter. 

Thank you and God bless. 

Yours faithfully, 

Mr Joe Mark

Ah.  I had forgotten that was settable.  

Preferences, Folder Display, ""Action when Target Button

Hi,

You can make $50,000 or more in the next 90 days sending e-mail.
Seem impossible? Is there a catch?  NO, there is no catch; just
send your e-mails and be on your way to financial freedom.

Basically, I send out as many of these e-mails as I can, then
people send me CASH in the mail for information that I just e-mail
back to them. Everyday, I make a three minute drive to my P.O. Box
knowing that there are at least a few hundred dollars waiting for
me.  And the best part, IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL.

Just read the next few paragraphs and see what you think. If you
like what you read, great! If you don't, read it again because you
must have missed something.

""AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TELEVISION""

""Making over a half million dollars every 6 months from your home
for an investment of only $25 US dollars expense ONE TIME.  THANKS
TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET, BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS
WITHIN A YEAR!!!  Before you say, ""No Way!"" read the following.
This is the letter you've been reading about in the news lately.
Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a major
nightly news program recently devoted an entire show to the
investigation of the program described below to see if it really
can make people money.

The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are absolutely
no laws prohibiting the participation in this program. This has
helped to show people that this is a simple, harmless, and fun way
to make some extra money at home.

The results of this show have been truly remarkable. So many
people are participating that those involved are doing much better
than ever before. Since everyone makes more as more people try it
out, its been very exciting to be a part of it lately. You will
understand once you experience it.

""HERE IT IS BELOW""

*** Print This Now For Future Reference ***

The following income opportunity is one you may be interested in
taking a look at. It can be started with VERY LITTLE investment
($25) and the income return is TREMENDOUS!!!

THIS IS A LEGITIMATE, LEGAL, MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY.

It does not require you to come into contact with people, do any
hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave your house
except to get the mail.

Simply follow the instructions, and you really can make this
happen. This e-mail order marketing program works every time if
you put in the effort to make it work. E-mail is the sales tool of
the future. Take advantage of this non-commercialized method of
advertising NOW!

The longer you wait, the more savvy people will be taking your
business using e-mail. Get what is rightfully yours. Program
yourself for success and dare to think BIG. It sounds corny, but
it's true. You'll never make it big if you don't have this belief
system in place.

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING (MLM) has finally gained respectability.  It
is being taught in the Harvard Business School, and both Stanford
Research and the Wall Street Journal have stated that between 50%
and 65% of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level
methods.
This is a Multi-Billion Dollar industry and of the 500,000
millionaires in the U.S., 20% (100,000) made their fortune in the
last several years in MLM. Moreover, statistics show 45people
become millionaires everyday through Multi-Level Marketing.

You may have heard this story before, but Donald Trump made an
appearance on the David Letterman show. Dave asked him what he
would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch.
Without hesitating Trump said he would find a good network
marketing company and get to work.
The audience, started to hoot and boo him. He looked out at the
audience and dead-panned his response. ""That's why I'm sitting up
here and you are all sitting out there!""

With network marketing you have two sources of income. Direct
commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from
sales made by people you introduce to the business.

Residual income is the secret of the wealthy. It means investing
time and money once, and getting paid again and again and again.
In network marketing, it also means getting paid for the work of
others.

The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my
fingers. Fortunately, sometime later I reread everything and gave
some thought and study to it.

My name is Jonathan Rourke. Two years ago, the corporation I
worked at for the past twelve years down- sized and my position
was eliminated. After unproductive job interviews, I decided to
open my own business. Over the past year, I incurred many
unforeseen financial problems. I owed my family, friends and
creditors over $35,000. The economy was taking a toll on my
business and I just couldn't seem to make ends meet. I had to
refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and
struggling business. AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened
in my life and I am writing to share that experience in hopes that
this will change your life FOREVER FINANCIALLY!!!

In mid December, I received this program via e-mail. Six month's
prior to receiving this program, I had been sending away for
information on various business opportunities. All of the programs
I received, in my opinion were not cost effective. They were
either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial
investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work
or not. One claimed that I would make a million dollars in one
year. It didn't tell me I'd have to write a book to make it!

But like I was saying, in December I received this program. I
didn't send for it, or ask for it; they just got my name off a
mailing list. THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT!!!
After reading it several times, to make sure I was reading it
correctly, I couldn't believe my eyes.

Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON.

I could invest as much as I wanted to start without putting me
further into debt. After I got a pencil and paper and figured it
out, I would at least get my money back. But like most of you I
was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal
aspects of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Post Office
(1-800-725-2161 24 hrs) and they confirmed that it is indeed
legal! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN
LETTER, I decided ""WHY NOT.""

Initially I sent out 10,000 e-mails. It cost me about $15 for my
time on-line. The great thing about e-mail is that I don't need
any money for printing to send out the program, and because all of
my orders are filled via e-mail, the only expense is my time. I am
telling you like it is. I hope it doesn't turn you off, but I
promised myself that I would not 'rip-off"" anyone, no matter how
much money it cost me.
Here is the basic version of what you need to do:

Your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for Report #1
within 2 weeks of your first program going out. IF YOU DON'T, SEND
OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.

Your second goal is to receive at least 150+ orders for Report #2
within 4 weeks. IF NOT, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO.

Once you have your 150 orders, relax, you've met your goal. You
will make $50,000+ but keep at it! If you don't get 150 right off,
keep at it! It may take some time for your down line to build.
Keep at it, stay focused, and do not let yourself get distracted.

In less than one week, I was starting to receive orders for REPORT
#1. I kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by January 13,
1 had received 26 orders for REPORT #1. My first step in making
$50,000 in 90 days was done.

By January 30, 1 had received 196 orders for REPORT #2; 46 more
than I needed. So I sat back and relaxed. By March 1, of my
e-mailing of 10,000, I received $58,000 with more coming in every
day. I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car.
Please take time to read the attached program, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR
LIFE FOREVER!!  Remember, it won't work if you don't try it. This
program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the
rules of not trying to place your name in a different place. It
won't work, you'll lose out on a lot of money!

In order for this program to work very fast, try to meet your goal
of 20+ orders for Report #1, and 150+ orders for Report #2 and you
will make $50,000 or more in 90 days. If you don't reach the first
two goals with in four weeks, relax, you will still make a ton of
money, it may take a few months or so longer. But keep mailing out
the programs and stay focused! That's the key.  I AM LIVING PROOF
THAT IT WORKS!!! If you choose not to participate in this program,
I am sorry. It really is a great opportunity with little cost or
risk to you. If you choose to participate, follow the program and
you will be on your way to financial security.

If you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble
like I was, or you want to start your own business, consider this
a sign. I DID!  -Sincerely,  Jonathan Rourke

P.S.  Do you have any idea what 11,700 $5 bills ($58,000) look
like piled up on a kitchen table? IT'S AWESOME!

A PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:

By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports, you
should have concluded that such a program, and one that is legal,
could not have been created by an amateur.

Let me tell you a little about myself. I had a profitable business
for 10 years. Then in 1979 my business began falling off. I was
doing the same things that were previously successful for me, but
it wasn't working.

Finally, I figured it out. It wasn't me; it was the economy.
Inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had
been with us since 1945.

I don't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment
rate...because many of you know from first hand experience. There
were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before.

The middle class was vanishing. Those who knew what they were
doing invested wisely and moved up. Those who did not including
those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down
into the ranks of the poor.

As the saying goes, 'THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER.""
The traditional Methods of making money will never allow you to
""move up"" or ""get rich"". Inflation will see to that.

You have just received information that can give you financial
freedom for the rest of your life, with ""NO RISK"" and ""JUST A
LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT."" You can make more money in the next few
months than you have ever imagined.

Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do not change it in any
way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Remember to e-mail a
copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of. One of
the people you send this to may send out 50,000 ... and your name
will be on everyone of them!

Remember though, the more you send out the more potential
customers you will reach.

So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials
and opportunity to become financially independent.  IT IS UP TO
YOU NOW!

""THINK ABOUT IT."" Before you delete this program from your
mailbox, as I almost did, take a little time to read it and REALLY
THINK ABOUT IT. Get a pencil and figure out what could happen when
YOU participate. Figure out the worst possible response and no
matter how you calculate it, you will still make a lot of money!
You will definitely get back what you invested. Any doubts you
have will vanish when your first orders come in. IT WORKS! -Jody
Jacobs, Richmond, VA

HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU THOUSANDS OF DOLLAR$

This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS 100% EVERY TIME. I am
sure that you could use up to $50,000 or more in the next 90 days.

Before you say ""No Way!"" please read this program carefully. This
is not a chain letter, but a perfectly legal money making
opportunity. Basically, this is what you do:  As with all
multilevel businesses, we- build our business by recruiting new
partners and selling our products. Every state in the USA allows
you to recruit new multilevel business partners, and we offer a
product for EVERY dollar sent. YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE
FILLED BY E-MAIL, so you are not involved in personal selling. You
do it privately in your own home, store, or office.

This is the GREATEST Multi-Level Mail Order Marketing anywhere:
This is what you MUST do.

1. Order all 5 reports shown on the list below (You can't sell
them if you don't have them).

* For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE
REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR NAME &
RETURN ADDRESS (in case of a problem).

*MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE - IN CASE OF
ANY MAIL PROBLEMS!

* When you place your order, make sure you order each of the five
reports. You need all five reports so that you can save them on
your computer and resell them.

* Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the five
reports. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for
you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you.

2. IMPORTANT- DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed
next to each report, or their order
on the list in any way other than as instructed below in steps ""a""
through 'g"" or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.
Once you understand the way this works you'll also see how it
doesn't work if you change it. Remember, this method has been
tested, and if you alter it, it will not work.

a. Look below for the listing of available reports.

b. After you've ordered the. five reports, take this Advertisement
and remove the name and address under REPORT #5. This person has
made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their $50,000!

c. Move the name and address under REPORT #4 down to REPORT #5.

d. Move the name and address under REPORT #3 down to REPORT #4.

e. Move the name and address under REPORT #2 down to REPORT #3

f. Move the name and address under REPORT #1 down to REPORT #2.

g. Insert your name and address in the REPORT #1 position.

Please make sure you copy every name and address ACCURATELY! Copy
and paste method works well,.

3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names,
and save it to your computer. Make NO changes to the Instruction
portion of this letter.

Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely
you can afford $25). You obviously already have an Internet
Connection and e-mail is FREE!

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5
reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing
information which includes how to send bulk e-mails, where to find
thousands of free classified ads and much, much more.

Here are two primary methods of building your downline:

METHOD #1: SENDING BULK E-MAIL

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes,
and we'll assume you and all those involved send out only 2,000
programs each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives a 0.5%
response. Using a good list, the response could be much better.
Also, many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs
instead of 2,000. But continuing with this example, you send out
only 2,000 programs. With a 0.5% response, that is only 10 orders
for REPORT #1. Those 10 people respond by sending out 2,000
programs each for a total of 20,000. Out of those 0.5%, 100 people
respond and order REPORT #2.

Those 100 mail out 2,000 programs each for a total of 200,000. The
0.5% response to that is 1,000 orders for REPORT #3. Those 1,000
send out 2,000 programs each for a 2,000,000 total. The 0.5%
response to that is I 0,000 orders for REPORT #4. That amounts to
10,000 each of $5 bills for you in CASH MONEY! Then think about
level five!  That's $500,000 alone!

Your total income in this example is $50 + $500 + $5,000+ $50,000
+ $500,000 for a total of $555,550!!!

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING 1,990 OUT OF THE 2,000 PEOPLE
YOU MAIL TO WILL DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AND TRASH THIS PROGRAM!
DARE TO THINK FOR A MOMENT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF EVERYONE, OR HALF
SENT OUT 100,000 PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF 2,000. Believe me, many
people will do just that and more!

REPORT #2 will show you the best methods for bulk e-mailing, and
e-mail software.

METHOD #2 - PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

1. Advertising on the Net is very, very inexpensive, and there are
HUNDREDS of FREE places to advertise. Let's say you decide to
start small just to see how well it works. Assume your goal is to
get ONLY 10 people to participate on your first level. Placing a
lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger response.
Also assume that everyone else in YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10
downline members. Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING
results below:

1st level-your 10 members with $5 ....... $50
2nd level-10 members from those 10 ($5 x 100) ....... $500
3rd level-10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000).......  $5,000
4th level-10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10k) .......  $50,000
5th level-10 members from those 10,000 ($5 x 100k) .......  $500,000

THIS TOTALS     -      $555,550

Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate
only recruit 10 people each. Think for a moment what would happen
if they got 20 people to participate! Most people get 100's of
participants.

THINK ABOUT IT! For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is
e-mail them the report they ordered. THAT'S IT! ALWAYS PROVIDE
SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL ORDERS! This will guarantee that the
e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and address on it will be
prompt because they can't advertise until they receive the report!

AVAILABLE REPORTS         *** Order Each REPORT by NUMBER, AND
NAME ***

* ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH (U.S. CURRENCY) FOR EACH REPORT. CHECKS NOT
ACCEPTED * - ALWAYS SEND YOUR ORDER VIA FIRST CLASS MAIL - Make
sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets
of paper (SO THAT THE BILL CAN'T BE SEEN AGAINST LIGHT)  On one of
those sheets of paper include:
(a) the number & name of the report you are ordering,
(b) your e-mail address, and
(c) your name & postal address (in case your e-mail provider
encounters problems).

******* TIPS FOR SUCCESS *******

* TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS! Be prompt, professional, and follow
the directions accurately.

* Send for the five reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them when
the orders start coming in. When you receive a $5 order, you MUST
send out the requested product/report.

* ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.

* Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow the
instructions exactly, your results WILL BE SUCCESSFUL!

* ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!

******* YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES *******

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

Start posting ads as soon as you mail off for the reports! By the
time you start receiving orders, your reports will be in your
mailbox! For now, something simple, such as posting on message
boards something to the effect of ""Would you like to know how to
earn $50,000 working out of your house with NO initial investment?
Email me with the keywords ""more info"" to find out how. And, when
they email you, send them this report in response!

If you don't receive 20 orders for REPORT #1 within two weeks,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.

Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive at least 100
orders for REPORT#2. If you don't, continue advertising or sending
e-mails until you do. Once you have received 100 or more orders
for REPORT #2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already
working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in!

THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down
on the list you are placed in front of a DIFFERENT report. You can
KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are
ordering from you. If you want to generate more income, send
another batch of e-mails or continue placing ads and start the
whole process again! There is no limit to the income you will
generate from this business!

Before you make your decision as to whether or not you participate
in this program, answer one question ...
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE? If the answer is yes, please look
at the following facts about this program:

1. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO
PRODUCE!

2. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST ANYTHING TO SHIP!

3. YOU ARE SELLING A PRODUCT WHICH DOES NOT COST YOU ANYTHING TO
ADVERTISE!

4. YOU ARE UTILIZING THE POWER OF THE INTERNET AND THE POWER OF
MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING TO DISTRIBUTE YOUR PRODUCT ALL OVER THE
WORLD!

5. YOUR ONLY EXPENSES OTHER THAN YOUR INITIAL $25 INVESTMENT IS
YOUR TIME!

6. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE INCOME YOU GENERATE FROM THIS PROGRAM IS
PURE PROFIT!

7. THIS PROGRAM WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER.

******* TESTIMONIALS*******

This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially
the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position,
it won't work and you'll lose a lot of potential income. I'm
living proof that it works. It really is a great opportunity to
make relatively easy money, with little cost to you. If you do
choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and you'll be
on your way to financial security. -Steven Bardfield, Portland, OR

My name is Mitchell.  My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I
am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make
pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to Jody
about receiving ""junk mail."" I made fun of the whole thing,
spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved.
I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of
her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the
thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks
she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had
received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked! I was sure that
I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work. I AM a believer
now. I have joined Jody in her ""hobby. "" I did have seven more
years until retirement, but I think of the 'rat race,' and it's
not for me. We owe it all to MLM. -Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL.

The. main reason for this letter is to convince you that this
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to
get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached
several times before 1 checked this out. I joined just to see what
one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money
required. To my astonishment I received $36,470.00 in the first 14
weeks, with money still coming in.
-Charles Morris, Esq.

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up
my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I
decided that the initial investment was so little that there was
just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my
money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my medium- size post
office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it got so overloaded
that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll make
more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice
thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live.
There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
-Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA

I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I
wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I
was e-mailed another program ... 11 months passed then it came ...
I didn't delete this one! ... I made. more than $41,000 on the
first try!!  -Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA

This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit
our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the
interest on our money. The only way on earth that this plan will
work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your family's
sake don't pass up this golden opportunity. Good luck and happy
spending!  -Kerry Ford, Centerport, NY

As a general rule, not being able to solve a problem leads to
frustation. However, the conclusion you reach at is not in any way
following but a subjective *logic*.

BTW, you actually checked the permissions on that bootloader, didn't
you?

Good luck anyway.

I agree. I guess from now on nvidia will be pushing their own proprietary

I find it a bit more difficult to manage (if you change the kernel, you 
need to recompile the driver again).

As a KDE user I currently know of one bug (it has been reported to the 
Debian maintainer), applies to unstable or Squeeze, ""plasma-widget-yawp"" 
will not connect/work, any version yawp, any version kde 4, it can be

""License"" and/or patents are very important if you want to distribute 
your work and W3C should care about recommending a technology or 
specification that may have a non-clear license or make use of hidden 
patended software.

I still remember the Eolas issue that hit Internet Explorer ;-)

What I wanted to say is that in the event I had to choose a format for 
delivering my work, I -for sure- wouldn't go for Flash, although Adobe 
claims is ""open"".

OTOH, as many others have pointed out, Flash format maybe now open, but 
""players"" are still in a very bad shape (and I am not talking about Gnash/
swfdec, but Adobe's own flash player for linux). It's crappy and buggy.

So the reality is that anyone wanting to view a flash based site has to 
have Adobe Flash player installed as is the only one able to fully 
support all the features listed in their ""open"" specs.

And the same situation goes for Adobe Reader for Linux. I dunno what is 
going on with Adobe but true is that I dislike the path is taking that 
company :-/

 Alas, I've been following that howto, and it doesn't seem to work. It
could be because i'm using ext3 for the rootfs though.

I too have an  Abit NF7 (tho' not an -S).  The memory was installed by the=
=20
shop where I bought the components of my computer.  (I was intending to bui=
ld=20
it myself and he didn't trust me with the CPU or memory!!)  He told me taht=
 I=20
had dual channel memory installed, and would need to replace both 256 Mb=20
sticks if I increased the memory capacity.

I have never seen any sign of dual channel operation. (Tho' I didn't know w=
hat=20
to look for, which hardly helped!)

dmidecode gives:

Memory Device
       [snip]
        Size: 256 MB

moving one of the modules that dual channel functions?  And also, if that=20

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit

flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people.

tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to 
cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM.

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet 
abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income 
you've dreamed about is easier than you think!

There is, actually this holds for any package:

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


I am delurking to comment on the Salon article. I just wanted to say that I am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought. I sent it in a couple of days before the 9/11 commeration. If I had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on 9/11 my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged. However, I watch the Frontline show ""Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero"" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers.
I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?).
Thanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program. My shallow comment on Salon and others like it (my boyfriend and I had sex while the towers collapsed) gives me pause about how some of us tend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others.

No it wasn't, and at one point it worked fine.  I'll check and see why it

Yes it does. And if you're missing the dependencies needed for the selected

Yup... unfortunately the alsa-kernel needs to be rebuilt for each kernel,
and there's no way of avoiding it.

 Endeavors Technology and RSA Security Form Strategic Partnership to 
 Enhance SSL Performance in Secure, Enterprise-Scalable P2P Computing

Endeavors Technology and RSA Security combine their respective peer-to-peer Magi Enterprise 
Web collaboration and RSA BSAFE software for SSL users to instantly extend security and improve performance
of 
desktop and corporate data sharing, and Web interaction between workgroups inside and across corporations.

Irvine (CA) and Cambridge (UK), September 12, 2002 - Secure web collaboration software leader Endeavors
Technology, Inc. today
announced a technology sharing and marketing agreement with RSA Security Inc. the most trusted name in
e-security. This strategic
partnership is aimed at extending the security and improving the performance of the standard SSL security
protocol used by every e-based
desktop, laptop and server. 

Under the terms of the agreement, RSA Security's trusted security tools are embedded into Endeavors
Technology's award-winning Magi
Enterprise software product. The combined solution enables IT managers and users to simply extend security and
encryption to every
Magi-enabled device for the direct device-to-device sharing and interaction of corporate data and workflow
between workgroups within and
beyond the enterprise.

Secure collaboration between desktops and corporate systems calls for enterprises to build complex and costly
network infrastructures. This
combination of technologies from the two companies eliminates both overheads, and also the need for specific
security tools for each desktop
application such as Microsoft Project. With Magi's secure RSA Security-based peer environment, collaboration
can now be rapidly, easily and
securely extended across all devices and company firewalls, and workgroups can interact with colleagues,
partners and clients without concern
in compromising corporate information. This brings true Internet scaling to corporations needing to interact
highly securely with strong
encryption and authentication across firewalls.

""In these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,"" says
Bernard Hulme, chairman and
CEO of Endeavors Technology. ""Embedding RSA Security encryption software into Magi products provides IT
managers with added
assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of business-centric
peer-to-peer computing""

Endeavors Technology joins the RSA Secured Partner Program. The program is designed to ensure complete
interoperability between
partner products and RSA Security's solutions including RSA SecurID two-factor authentication, RSA
ClearTrust Web access
management, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keon digital certificate management.

The strategic partnership paves the way for Magi Enterprise to bear the RSA Secured brand on product packaging
and advertising, be listed in
RSA Secured Partner Solutions directories, and have RSA Security's out-of-the-box, certified interoperability.
It will also lead to joint
marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on
joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide
business continuity support.

""Endeavors Technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highest-level of security in its enterprise
products and streamlining the
deployment process for IT managers,"" says Stuart Cohen, director of partner development at RSA Security. ""By
combining our products,
enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls.""

About Magi
Magi Enterprise 3.0, an award-winning web collaboration system, transforms today's Web into a highly secure
inter- and intra-enterprise
collaboration network. For the first time, enterprises can implement ad-hoc Virtual Private Networks for
collaboration very rapidly and
affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. Magi Enterprise 3.0 does this
by effectively transforming
unsecured, ""read-only"" Web networks into two-way trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through
the use of such features as
cross-firewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name
spaces generating ""follow me URLs""
for mobile professionals.

About RSA Security, Inc.

SecurID two-factor authentication, RSA ClearTrust Web access management, RSA BSAFE encryption and RSA Keon

more than ten million RSA
SecurID authentication users and almost 20 years of industry experience, RSA Security has the proven

I don't think that you need ""# updatedefaultentry=true"" if you are
using ""default saved"". IIUC, I only has any meaning in the case of
""default x"" where x is a number.

IIUC, ""# savedefault=true"" will append ""savedefault"" to the menu
entries and, booting from one of those entries turns it into the
default at the next boot if you choose ""default saved"".

I have not tried ""default saved"" with grub1, but with grub2 it will
not work (the first time that you set it) if you don't run
""grub-set-default x"" where x is the default entry that you want (the
count starts with 0).

It may well take 450 people to turn KDE 3.5 into KDE 4.  It takes

My laptop has a Via C3 processor. I use Debian with a self-compiled
2.4.19 kernel, and have had absolutely no problems with the chip at all
(quite the opposite, in fact).

I had to compile for ""686"" in order for 3D acceleration to work (the
kernel has an option specifically for the Via C3), but I assume that was
a kernel problem rather than a hardware problem.

I do not agree, sorry. PDFLaTeX generally write bigger PDFs, simply
because there is no compression (consider for example
http://www.tug.org/pipermail/pdftex/2004-June/005046.html). Moreover, I
think that psTricks does not work with PDFLaTeX (you need to use PDFTrick=
s).

I also vaguely remember about many situations where, if I had had to use
PDFLaTeX, I would not have been able to produce the same document,
because I would have had to change many packages which were incompatible.=


You might ask on comp.text.tex, this is a better place for this, because
this is my point of view, and it is not shared by the whole community.

I was just offering anecdotal first-hand experiences from a number of
cultures indicating 1) we apparently have a problem 2) which requires more
than ad hoc hand-waving approach (it's trivial! it's obvious! all we have

That's easy. Divorce didn't happen. The church and the society looked
after that. Only relatively recently that privilege was granted to kings, 
and only very recently to commoners.

1) I'm seeing lack of innovation, and -- more disturbing -- trend towards
even less innovation by an autocatalytic process (gerontocracy favors
gerontocracy).

My point was that the west, US first and foremost, importing innovation

import. While this kinda, sorta works on the short run, this is not
something sustainable."

act.DTL

Opening arguments are set to begin early next month in Eldred vs. Ashcroft,
a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyright
law, including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work of
others.

....

To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internet
bookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that will
bring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,
before arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,
libraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free
high-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are
already in the public domain.

--------

I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and
saw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a
small satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding
machine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a
copy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total
fixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA
had the equipment donated) is under $10k.

One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if
they wished, add these ""virtual holdings"" (public domain materials) to their
existing library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be
compelling to small libraries in remote areas.

Oh, neat.

I have similiar thing in my hands, though it might be migratable if I
had the time to try. I've been using another 6.x repository though.
http://apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org/apt

Anyone tried (dist-)upgrade from 6.x to 7? Theoretically it should drop
in some -compat's (notably libc) and upgrade the rest and after a reboot
and maybe a new kernel (and grub, but I have long before put those to
v6's :) run just fine. Haven't had a spare machine to try it on myself,
though.

AFAIK that's not true for writes (they may even slow down slightly).
But in any case, this does not contradict the fact that the kind of
protection it offers is different from the one offered by using backup.

 Ah, you see - cobalt's don't use lilo. They have an openboot-like prom
that looks in an ext2 partition in /dev/hda1 for a file called
/boot/vmlinux.gz - nothing else.

 The only way I think you can set parameters is with a ""set_params"" line.

 However, when I run 
    set_params root=/dev/hda2
 and then run:
    bfd /boot/vmlinux.gz

 It boots the old kernel, I assume from the prom. It seems to do this, if
something goes wrong - no error, just boots the default kernel.

 BTW, 'bfd' means 'boot from disk'.

Hi,

When copying and pasting a .ps or a .pdf file, or a serie of such files,
the resulting (i.e. pasted) files' icon is often the `snippets' one,
i.e. the one which designates a broken/corrupted file. However, when
right-clicking on the files, their content appears as the icon, i.e. the
`snippets' icon disappears. Why? Is it normal? I do not like copying and
pasting files and seeing such an icon, because one might think that
these are corrupted files.

Thanks.

802,"Re: Got Ink?              21846What have you been up to?
I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of going
down to the store to find out that your printer cartridges
cost more than the printer itself! I know how you feel
- I print over 500 pages a day, and it feels like there is
a vacuum sucking money out of my wallet! Now, this has got
to stop because I know it doesn't cost the printer companies
anywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work!
Well, it finally has.  The SUPERINK solution.

You're probably thinking to yourself, ""Gosh darn, not another
cheap knockoff printer cartridge!"" Like you, I was very 
skeptical at first, but my best friend & business associate
said it helped her save over $100 a month on printer supplies. 
So I tried it. I mean, there was nothing to lose because they
offer a 100% satisfaction guarantee, up to a one-year warranty
on all of their products and FREE Shipping on ALL orders!
Let me tell you, it was one of the best decisions I've ever made.
Period. Six months later, as I'm writing this message to you,
I've gone from spending $1000 dollars a month on printer supplies
to Now ONLY $475! and I haven't had to sacrifice the quality or
service that I received from the local office supply store. In fact,
the service is even BETTER!  I've had 1 defective cartridge since 
I started dealing with SUPERINK and they sent me a new replacement
within 3 days, no questions asked. Now, I can print all I want!

I was so happy with the results that I contacted their manufacturer
and got permission to be a reseller - at a BIG discount. I want
to help other people to avoid getting jipped by the printer companies
like I did. Because a penny saved is a penny earned! 
I give you my personal pledge the SUPERINK soltuion will absolutely
WORK FOR YOU. If it doesn't, you can return your order anytime
for a full refund.  

If you are frustrated with dishing out money like it is water to the
printer companies, or tired of poor quality ink & toner cartridges,
then I recommend - the SUPERINK solution.

You're probably asking yourself, ""Ok, so how do we save all this money
without losing quality and service?""

Modern technology has provided SUPERINK with unique, revolutionary
methods of wax molding that allow the ink & toner to 'settle', which
prevents any substantial damage that would occur during shipping and
handling. Nothing ""magic"" about it - just quality & savings, BIG SAVINGS!

Here is the bottom line ...

I can help you save 30%-70% per week/per month/per year or per lifetime 
by purchasing any of our ink & toner supplies. Just try it once, you'll 
keep coming back - there's nothing to lose, and much MONEY to be saved! 
100% Satisfaction Guaranteed. You will be able to print as much as you
want without wasting money or sacrificing quality - GUARANTEED.
That is my pledge to you.

Date: Not supplied

John Robb has an interesting perspective on trust-based, targetted advertising
[1] based on his experiences at Gomez during the heady days of the Internet 
gold rush. 

Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There's a lot of evidence that 
advertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a 
product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where 
consumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. 

There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first 
rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our 
immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium 
to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. 
And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead 
of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.

Ext3 basically syncs to disk every 5 seconds or so.  Ext4 didn't, but it's=

possible that has been / will be put back.  XFS uses longer gaps between di=
sk=20
syncs by default, but it is tunable.

You could always use the ""sync"" file system option to avoid the whole issue=

If that's no good enough, a simple shell script (while sleep 5; do sync; do=

running as root (perhaps started from init) will fill basically the same ro=

Both XFS and Ext3/4 recover through journal replay, and it is usually enoug=

Rarely, a manual filesystem check will be required, and xfs_check is usuall=

921,"kde-core list should be updated (live-helper)Hello all,

I just received a notification that meta-kde 5:59 has entered unstable/sid.
With that, the meta package kde-minimal does no longer exist, so /usr/share/live-helper/lists/kde-
core should be updated and possibly again when 5:59 gets into testing/squeeze.

This is the contents of that file now (primairily for debian-kde list):
#if DISTRIBUTION lenny
kde-core
#endif
#if DISTRIBUTION squeeze sid
kde-minimal
#endif

kdm
desktop-base


I think the following change should correct the change in the meta-package:
#if DISTRIBUTION squeeze sid
kde-minimal
#endif

becomes:

#if DISTRIBUTION squeeze
kde-minimal
#endif
#if DISTRIBUTION sid
kde-plasma-desktop
#endif

and when 5:59 gets into testing it should become:
#if DISTRIBUTION squeeze sid
kde-plasma-desktop
#endif

I'm CC-ing debian-kde list, since they probably can add sth useful to this.

I got the DSL-W 906E from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk.

Though it's not at all the best one around I have to say it does the job
and a bit. Some of the features can be a pain to get working (ie. pptp in
pppoe mode - can't figure it out). The documentation is not the best, but
the guys from http://www.dsl-warehouse.co.uk will help you ouit. They
also have a message board.

The command line interface is quite powerful, but absolutely not
userfriendly.

All in all it's a cheap desent performer, that I am happy enough with.
Got this one including a microfilter (not needed) for 140euro including
shipping. Better than any deal from Eircom.

depart today, contrary to my normal practice, to take a few minutes explaining a 




recent metaphor.

I'm a Linux guy through and through. As a user, I see myself as right about at 
the average on the curve. For love of the language and open source attitude, 
though, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone with quite the same level of 
enthusiasm. Put simply, there's very little about the Linux and broader open 
source worlds that I don't like or believe in.

Take, for example, the practice of recursive acronyms. GNU (""Gnu's Not Unix""), 
HURD (""Herd of Unix-Replacing Daemons""), WINE (""Wine Is Not an Emulator""), even 
PHP (""PHP Hypertext Processor"") - all carry on the tradition of recursion in the 




Unix/Linux world. Goofy as it sounds, I love this stuff.

So it is that I set out to create a recursive metaphor last week. It could only 
have happened on or about the 4th of July. In fact, it happened in the edition 
of the 3rd. I wrote a piece about how we Americans spend more time over the 
course of a year talking about what's wrong with our system than what's 
right. I wrote it knowing full well that many of the responses I'd get would be 
a) from readers outside the US and b) in sharp disagreement to my comments or 
those of citizens of other countries. You're following me, right? People would 
disagree with an article that said we spend much time disagreeing. This, of 
course, would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical way - the perfect 
recursive metaphor. The point was to be made yet more perfectly by the eventual 
inclusion in Penguin Shell of the comments of someone from outside the US 




disagreeing with my take our argumentativeness as Americans. Ideally, they would 




be comments that disagreed with our collective American perception of being 
disagreeable. They would, of course, point out things about which citizens of 
other countries can disagree with Americans on. By exercising the right to 
disagree, we'd subtly agree that we have that right. Yet another level of 
recursion and a final layer of metaphor.

The response to both my own and Johan Sauviller's comments was overwhelming. In 
the main, I believe both were appreciated. Many commented on the balance of the 
two pieces. Some readers were surprised, I think, to see a dissenting opinion 
published so quickly, if at all. Overall, the ability to express honestly held 
opinions, to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the circle on the 
metaphor in a perfect way.

Things have, however, gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days. I'm not sure 
whether some were slow in getting to the July 3rd issue, or whether it's just 
been stewing since then. Take, for instance, these comments by a reader who will 




remain mercifully nameless:


We get enough
America bashing from our left-wing whacko extremist press and schools here
in the USA that we don't wish to hear some (insert favorite adjective here)
from Belgium whining too!


Followed by:


... please don't let Tony single-handedly tarnish the fine reputation
of Lockergnome. I'm sure there are other articulate Linux experts out there who 
would be able to replace him.


... and, in a later note on the topic ...


Censorship is to be encouraged in a
free-market society whenever and wherever it doesn't come from the
government.


Clearly, the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some.

Chris 




has been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the editorial 
piece at the beginning of each newsletter. This particular piece is no 
exception. He's shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill 
comments. While we all generally stay focused on technical issues, Chris has 
shown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are, in the end, humans 
with opinions and thoughts to share. I think it's one of the things that makes 
the Lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack - the personal touch.

So, despite the irrationality of some of this week's comments, I'll continue to 
occasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff.

Just watch out. Recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye 
out.

Win Apps in Linux?

Yesterday, I mentioned an interesting review of two products for Linux by CodeWeavers - CrossOver 
Office and CrossOver Plugin. You've probably heard of both by now, as they've 
garnered quite a bit of publicity both in and out of the Linux world. You'll 
recall that I promised to try to secure copies for review this week. With the 
help of a friendly sales rep at CodeWeavers, I was able to accomplish that task 
this morning. True to the second half of the promise, we'll spend the next few 
days looking at these two products and how they might impact your Linux use. 
Let's take them in chronological order, starting today with CrossOver Plugin.

A bit of background is in order. CodeWeavers is, in their own words, "" ... the 
leading corporate backer of the Wine Project. Wine has been, for the past several years, an 
ongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux. It's a tough goal, but 
it's also one that's been undertaken by others in the past year or so. Though the progress has been 
slow, the Wine project has managed to stay at the front of this development 
realm.

CrossOver 
Plugin marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project. Prior to its 
release, Wine had taken a ""full system"" approach. Running Windows applications 
in Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no small amount of 
configuration work. CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from the system-wide 
approach to one that's much more modular. Rather than executing at system 
startup, Wine is called as-needed, with the virtual Windows path to the called 
program. When the program is closed, so is Wine. CrossOver Plugin has focused on 



creating Linux functionality with one related set of Windows 
applications: browser plugins.

The results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a 
success. Off the top, CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime 5, Windows Media Player 



6.2, Shockwave 8.5, Flash 6, and RealPlayer 8 into a Linux-accesible browser 
plugin package. Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix, Trillian, Authorware Web 
Player 6 and eFax Messenger 2, and you've got virtually every need plugin need 
covered.

But this package doesn't stop there. Included in the CrossOver Plugin package 
are viewers for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, as well as several 
Microsoft-oriented fonts. Honestly, I was stunned at the range of applications 
offered by the CodeWeavers developers.

Having had some experience with Wine, I was a bit leery about the install 
process and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with 
my RedHat setup. I've never been completely successful with Wine, but I hoped 
for the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation. I really did want 



these apps to work.

The installation was quite easy. By running the install-crossover.sh script from 



the command line, I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver Plugin 



and CrossOver Office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. I started the plugin 
installs with QuickTime, a tool I've admittedly missed in Linux. In the 
background, CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C:\ drive on my 
machine. I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar sight 



- the Vise installer in its Windows format. CrossOver Plugin first checked for 
feedback from the Windows binary, opened a virtual Windows window, then stepped 
out while the Vise installer took care of the rest. Though the install failed 
four times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a failure of the 
CrossOver program. I kept ""retry""ing and, with some persistence, managed to get 
a full QuickTime 5 install downloaded from the Apple servers. Quite literally, 
the install looked and performed exactly as I've seem many times in Windows. 
When the install was completed, CrossOver again checked for the Windows binary, 
located the appropriate .dll files in the virtual C:\ drive and dropped the 
plugins into the /home/tony/.netscape/plugins and /home/tony/.mozilla/plugins 
directories.

The process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these 
browsers - ""Help"", ""About Plugins."" Sure enough, the CrossOver QuickTime plugin 
was listed. Quickly, I ran out to the Apple site and opened the ""Men In Black 
II"" movie trailer. QuickTime performed flawlessly.

I followed with the Windows Media Player, Shockwave, Flash, IPix, and eFax 
Messenger installs. Of those, the only ones that weren't self-contained in the 
CrossOver install were IPix and eFax. Even at that, the installer pointed me to 
the Windows download then found the .exe file when the download was done. Within 



a half-hour, I had all installed and tested.

Then, just for grins, I installed RealPlayer 8 via CrossOver. This was despite 
the recommendation in the installer screen to use the Linux version. It went as 
smoothly as the others with one caveat - the player played media files at a much 



faster speed than that in Windows. Fast enough to make me laugh, in fact, 
reminded of Dave and Alvin the Chipmunk. Ah well, six out of seven is pretty 
strong given my previous troubles with Wine.

I also installed a few fonts - Arial, Times New Roman, Trebuchet, and Veranda. 
In every case, the install was quick and absolutely painless.

Wine has always held great promise. At times, it's been painful to watch the 
tedious pace of development, only because that promise was so alluring. With the 



backing of CodeWeavers and a fundamental change in the approach to development, 
Wine has finally realized the goal of integrating Windows applications 
seamlessly into the stable Linux environment. The results are so strong that, if 



I didn't know better, I'd swear that a few of these plugins actually run better 
in Linux than in their native Windows. Honestly, I didn't realize how much I 
missed them until I started using them in Linux today.

Tomorrow holds a few surpirses, with a look at CodeWeavers' CrossOver Office 
package.

Kernel Configuration - Part IX

We're nine parts into the kernel configuration series, with quite a bit yet to 
go. If you haven't been following along, we're breaking out the configuration 
screens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and 
function of each. With that knowledge, you should be able to make a clear 
decision as to how to configure each section.

Today, it's the Parallel Port support section. This is pretty simple. If you 
need parallel port support - such as for a printer - select this option either 
as a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module.

Most will use the PC-style hardware option in conjuction with a Windows printer. 



But that's not all the parallel port can be used for. As an example, the builds 
I did with the telescope company required parallel port support, as the 
telescope cameras were attached to this port.

Be aware - this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for 
the parallel port. The computer's BIOS sets the mode for the port - ECP, EPP, or 



Auto. On the majority of modern computers, the Auto mode is the default and will 



work just fine. However, if you have problems communicating with your printer 
following a kernel recompile, try changing the mode of your printer in the 
BIOS.

Tomorrow, it's Plug and Play configuration.

Once you have the serial changed on the master DNS server, remove

Bind has a special case, if you set the serial to '0' I think. DNS &

This was poking fun of the practice of making
up differnt types of speech with different
types of protected status.  I think the
laws specialing out hate and protected speech
are ridiculous.  The point I keep trying to make
is that there's only two types, speech and action. 
I agree, they are all speech and should be 
covered by the First Amendment, but

If hate speech is so protected, why are certain
states trying to prosecute people for it?  There's
only two answers and one of them is wrong.

  1) Because hate speech is different and needs to
     have a different level of protection dictated
     by whoever's offended at the time.
  2) It's because it's not just speech, but action.
     A action who's consequences are foreseeable by 
     any reasonable person. 

Hate speech is mislabeled.  It's really ""threat"".  I think
they let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantage
in being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and
money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY
don't like.

There is nothing in the way to install *both* kernels. Just give the 686
a try and if it does not work you can just reboot into the 486 and
uninstall the 686. Make sure that the 486 is installed before you try

Since you seem fine with RAID 6, I'll assume you are also fine with RAID 5.

I don't know what your requirements / levels of paranoia are, but RAID 5 is=

probably better than RAID 6 until you are up to 6 or 7 drives; the chance o=

double failure in a 5 (or less) drive array is minuscule.

Modern mdadm can migrate from RAID 5 to RAID 6 when you add the 6th/7th dri=
ve=20
into the array.

Also modem mdadm has a wealth of RAID 1/0 features that may actually be a=20
better performance-wise than RAID 5 or RAID 6.

You can add the failed device back into the array and it will re-sync until=

there is another issue with the device.  Just be sure to remember which dev=

For some reason debian stock kernel is taking only ide drivers.  I

Sorry if I'm being dense, I said I'm not a networking expert.  But I 
have thought about this, and I am not seeing how it wouldn't work.

192.168.11.1 is:
11000000 10101000 00001011 00000001

192.168.11.55 is:
11000000 10101000 00001011 00110111

So, the computer at 192.168.11.55 will think it's subnet is the first 22 
bits of the address, which is 11000000 10101000 000010, which matches 
the first 22 bits of the router address.  So far so good.  Client side 
will think the machine at 192.168.11.1 is on the same IP subnet, so it 
will do an ARP request for 192.168.11.1 (ARP doesn't care about subnet 
masks, it just does an Ethernet broadcast), which will succeed, and the 
server will be able to send to the router.  The reverse direction is 
also true.

What am I missing?

Agreed.

But I have always thought that the value 5 was not the best value.  It
should have been 0.  I understand that initially only spammy scores
were included.  But I believe the algorithm should be purely
symmetrical and non-spammy negative values should also have been
balancing out the spammy positive values, like they do in SA today.
Then anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative
would be non-spam.  (And I guess exactly zero is grey. :-) Today's
choice of 5 just adds an offset.  Which I think cause people to assume
things work differently than they do.

To my knowledge, no part of the Bluetooth frameworks documentation
says anything about thread safety, and for that reason you must assume
that it is only safe to use from the main thread.

Also, a thread's run loop will only run if it has either run loop
sources or timers attached; the fact that NSRunLoop's -run ever
returns means that it has neither. This is what I would expect based
on your -startBlueToothThread: method, as it doesn't appear to create
a source or timer. If you wanted to keep the thread alive, I would
attach a dummy timer to the run loop that fires after some
extraordinary amount of time. (Assuming you're not using the Bluetooth
APIs on the thread...)

241,"Configuration errors using tor, privoxy & polipoDear all

On an up-to-date testing machine, I am using Iceweasel + tor + privoxy.  
Florian helped me with an issue like this sometime back, but revisiting 
his helpful advice has not helped on this occasion.

The situation is as follows:

Using Iceweasel, I enable the tor button and receive a warning message 
""Tor proxy test: local HTTP proxy is unreachable. Is polipo running 
properly?""

Well, no because polipo wasn't installed - why and when this suddenly 
became a necessity I don't know, but anyway I installed polipo and 
configured it according to the tutorial on 
http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Polipo which, in my circumstances, 
required me to uncomment this line in the config file:

         socksParentProxy = localhost:9050

Having restarted the daemons, and still getting the same error and no 
connection, I pointed the browser at privoxy as per the polipo 
configuration page referred to above, in the preferences/ network 
settings tab, and in the polipo config file, I uncommented the line:

         socksParentProxy = localhost:9050

I then restarted polipo, double-checked the privoxy config file to 
ensure that forwarding was still set as required and restarted the tor 
and privoxy daemons.  However, I still get the same error messages 
(basically cannot connect to web-pages) and the tor test gives the same 
results as before.

 From researching this on the web, I am unable to ascertain whether or 
not I even need polipo, but the preferences settings tab for the tor 
button have a check-box for using polipo, so it appears as if tor is now 
expecting polipo to be installed and running as default.  But, I have 
now reached the limit of what I know what to do or can figure out.  I am 
also conscious of the risk of screwing things up further in an effort to 
fix this, so before proceeding further would like to ask this list for 
help and advice.

I appreciate any thoughts/ ideas.

Thanks

AG

Actually, the problem is that nobody cares enough about KDE 3.5 to

YES, you can have KDE 3.5!  You can even have it as an official part of

You will need to make sure that there is sufficient upstream developer
committment to keep it usable and current, and you will need to make

upstream work, triage bugs, and cooridinate package updates with
upstream, the the release teams, the security team, etc etc.  Can you do
that?

This is by far the best app for converting 3gp files:
http://www.miksoft.net/mobileMediaConverter.htm

It's not cli, it's ugly, but it works better than anything else. The
sound qualit of the resulting files is excellent, and it will work in
batch.

  It's been about 20 years since a new Atari 400 or Commodore Vic
20 could be had for less than $200. Even then, those relics were
well on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history.
  Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than
$200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable.
  Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstarts

Gale turned his eyes down-stream to the barracks, and noted that the long flag-staff had at last been erected. Even as he looked he saw a bundle mounting towards its tip, and then beheld the Stars and Stripes flutter out in the air, while the men below cheered noisily. It was some time before he answered.

Mr. Barnett, will you go aloft and keep me posted? said the captain.  

Harley always travelled light, carrying only two valises, and an hour sufficed for his packing. Then, like the old campaigner that he was, he slept soundly, and early the next morning he went again to the hotel at which the Graysons were staying. He felt a little hesitation in sending up a card so soon, knowing what swarms of people Mr. Grayson had been compelled to receive and how badly he must stand in need of rest, but there was no help for it.  Let me look at it. 


 That trip was full of dangers for you, and, as we go through all this Western country, there may be more to come. I want the right, Sylvia, to look after you, to look after you more closely than I've ever done before, and to do that, Sylvia, I've got to be your husband.

Her voice failed her as she uttered the last sentence. But she restrained herself after the first sob that heaved her overladen bosom, and stood calmly awaiting the answer to her urgent petition.

It was she, with her youthful zeal, who inspired Mr. Grayson and his friends with courage for a conflict against odds. He consulted her daily about his speeches; it was she who always put into them some happy thought, some telling phrase that was sure to captivate the people. In a pinch she could make a speech herself, and she would probably be seen on the stump in the West.

Maybe.  But this is my primary machine and I want to keep it stable.  I
also don't have that much of a need any more to use the usb phone/modem.
If that changes, I might try a newer kernel.  In fact I might try a
backported kernel on another machine.  I'll report back when I do.

Looking for Property in Spain?

Don_t waste your Time! 
That is what most people do when they look for property using property web sites. Why?

 Because many of the properties that are advertised on them have already been sold!

 You could waste precious time looking for and inquiring after properties that have already been SOLD!

 How Frustrating!!! 

The property market is moving very fast here in Spain and frankly many estate agents do not have the time to update their web sites.

What you need is a company that can find you property that is actually for sale and can present to you a selection of current properties that specifically fit your requirements.

Just think of how much time and effort that would save you!

Property finders Spain 
can do just that!

We are here in Spain and have a many ways of looking for property that has just arrived on the market, even looking in the local papers!

It must be so great in the US.  The rest of us live in caves and have

Some logs might be of some help.

1) some output of /var/log/maillog with some relevant error message
(that could be /var/log/mail.log or some other log depending on your
configuration)

2) the output from ``postconf -n''

On another note, you did recreate the mailboxes, didn't you?
